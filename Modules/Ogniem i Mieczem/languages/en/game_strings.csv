str_retirement_text_1|Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last.

str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save.

str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless, drifting from tavern to tavern, begging drinks from indulgent patrons, regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time, the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honor at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns, that the young may keep a memory of you ever after.
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved does not last long, but it is enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon come to accept you, and in time, your growing tavern becomes a popular feast hall and meeting place.

str_retirement_text_6|You have saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver, and your intelligence, allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your former military exploits.
str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your hold at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your lord. Occasionally your lord calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring days of your youth. You have already made your fortune, and with your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you have done very well for yourself indeed. Your extensive holdings and the wealth you accumulated in your adventures are enough to guarantee a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your nation's royal court. When you are not busied with political intrigue, you hunt your private forests, feast in your hall, and tell your hundreds of fine war stories to your guests. You have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, which places you firmly among the major nobility of the realm. You are invested as baron of {s7}, and become one of your lord's closest advisors. Your renown garners much subtle influence and significant command. You spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old days of adventure and glory.
str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your lord holds you in high esteem, and but a small ripple of surprise passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {Count/Countess} of {s9}. Vast fiefs and fortunes are now yours to command. You quickly become your lord's most trusted advisor, almost his equal, and charged with much of the running of his realm. You sit upon a throne in your own splendorous palace, as one of the most powerful figures in the nation.

str_npc1_intro_response_2|This is no time for heartfelt recollections.
str_npc2_intro_response_2|Pardon me, I was confused...
str_npc3_intro_response_2|Heh, what an interesting surprise... Go now, holy father, God will provide...
str_npc4_intro_response_2|Thank you, but I am already leaving.
str_npc5_intro_response_2|Pardon me, but I am in a hurry.
str_npc6_intro_response_2|Looks can be deceiving.
str_npc7_intro_response_2|For God's sake, you are of no concern to me.
str_npc8_intro_response_2|Go, go out of here, you heathen. I don't know your gibberish tongue.
str_npc9_intro_response_2|We'll talk later, friend. I am in a hurry.
str_npc10_intro_response_2|I am glad. We shall meet later.
str_npc11_intro_response_2|Pardon me, I am in a hurry.
str_npc12_intro_response_2|Take these worms of yours and begone, bloodsucker!
str_npc13_intro_response_2|I have no time for the games of fortune tellers. Farewell.
str_npc14_intro_response_2|Pardon me, but I have no time to talk. Good evening to you...
str_npc15_intro_response_2|Nay and nay! I am leaving already...
str_npc16_intro_response_2|Why assume something bad right away? Never mind, I am leaving.
str_npc1_backstory_a|You're in luck, {son/my dear}. I am Colonel Zagloba!
str_npc2_backstory_a|I am the last survivor of an ancient house of Valash rulers. My famous ancestor, Vladislav Tepes, known as Dracula, was the scourge of the Turks, and the Lord of Transylvania!
str_npc3_backstory_a|For a while I am... How should I say... I have ceased to take up the holy orders.
str_npc4_backstory_a|Mamai is my name. I am the descendant of the famous Cossack from the bard's song. Of course, I would be hard pressed to strangle ten Poles with just my trousers, but I can wield the pike quite well.
str_npc5_backstory_a|Nay, I have merely been discharged for a time.
str_npc6_backstory_a|You speak the truth. I fled -- and who wouldn't? I come from Tula, but in recent years I have served as a Moscow marksman. I was once a famed hunter, and brought game from the forests to the royal halls.
str_npc7_backstory_a|Wine, vodka or schnapps -- it is my weakness. Just one little sip, and my body starts to itch.
str_npc8_backstory_a|Ah, I beg your pardon. Isanmesez means "do you still live?" It is a sort of greeting, like "how do you do".
str_npc9_backstory_a|My most humble apologies. Allow me to introduce myself -- I am Algirdas. My family name I would prefer to keep secret.
str_npc10_backstory_a|I am the heir of an ancient house, the roots of which stretch from the Old and New World alike. Buscadors fought in just about every war since the Reconquista.
str_npc11_backstory_a|The men of the Tatar Khan are hunting me. I exhausted three horses, and finally laid myself low here.
str_npc12_backstory_a|I am from Kiev. Learned to read and write at the Kiev-Bratsk college, and then I became a doctor. Until now, I offered myself to the Cossacks of the Kurenevskoe community. Healed them from hang-overs, offered bloodletting, dressed their wounds. And what a life it would have been, have I not met that French cartographer... what was his name... Guillaume de Beauplan. He fell ill as he was passing through Kiev, and I was summoned to apply leeches...
str_npc13_backstory_a|I am Oksana, a soothsayer. The arts of magic have been passed down through my family from times immemorial, from grandmother to granddaughter...
str_npc14_backstory_a|Oh certainly. I am an army quartermaster with a patent from the king of Sweden himself. Or, rather, I used to be...
str_npc15_backstory_a|My name is Varvara, of Novgorod. -- There I lived my whole life, before I became a widow.
str_npc16_backstory_a|Offended? Me? Believe me, those who offend me no longer walk this earth.
str_npc1_backstory_b|You could sooner count all leaves in the forest than all the enemies I have slain. Were my hair as numerous as the foes I've brought down by my own hand, the barbers would've made a fortune trimming my forelock! The devil take me if I lie...
str_npc2_backstory_b|The King of Hungary is the mortal enemy of the Valachs, and spread dreadful rumors that my ancestor had a thirst for blood! These legends and tales have become the bane of our family. The descendants of Dracula left Trasylvania, and I grew up in Kamenets, near the border. For a while now I have lived the life of a wanderer. It is not the life I would have chosen...
str_npc3_backstory_b|I am the priest Spasokukotsky. The bishop of Riga gave me a small village parish, but within the week he sent his sacrist there to check how well I was fulfilling my duties. After the Sunday mass this bore came to my humble cell. First he inquired what a parish woman was doing in my bed, and then had the gall to start preaching to me. He explained that one should not spin the censer over one's head during the sermon -- and I endured his condescension well enough. He said that prayers should be concluded by the word "Amen", and not by the word I spoke at the end, and still I remained silent. The parish loved my way of doing things, you understand! But then, when he began to shout that he saw goods from my Church being sold at the Riga market, I could no longer stand it any longer, and beat him with a staff so hard he barely made it out alive.
str_npc4_backstory_b|During the battle of Berestechek, when the Poles and Crimeans crushed Hmelnitski's forces utterly, I was captured by the Tatars. They brought me to Kafa, offered me a place as a mercenary for the Turkish Sultan. But instead I killed the guards and fled.
str_npc5_backstory_b|I served in the musket regiment of General Lennart Torstenson's, the finest commander in all of Sweden. I took part in the battle of Jankau, where we utterly defeated the very best of the German forces! Ah, those were the days!
str_npc6_backstory_b|My service went well, or would have, were it not for one Secret Department clerk. A skinny, wall-eyed fellow with a goatee, but he had set his sights on my wife. The foul creature knew that she was faithful to me, but he devised a dirty trick using the powers that came with his position. He whispered to the chief hunting clerk that I boasted in front of men that I saw a wondrous horse in the woods, that had a horn on its head. Our sire is quite keen on various rare animals, and so I was entrusted with the task of capturing this creature -- or get fired and thrown into the gaol for my idle talk.
str_npc7_backstory_b|My name is Yelisey. I am the fourth son of the Ryazan noble Skiba. From the cradle, my father prepared me for the duty of a warrior. I learned to ride, to shoot with pistols, and to fence.
str_npc8_backstory_b|I am Bakhyt. For fifteen years I was an aide to the Khan's executioner in Bakhchisaray. The work was busy, but I did not mind it... Until the new Khan installed a new Vizier, that is.
str_npc9_backstory_b|My ancestor received his title from the Grand Prince Algirdas at the end of the XIV century. For military valor he were granted vast lands near the town of Bryansk. Since that day all the eldest sons in our family bear his name. Our house served the Grand Duchy of Lithuania faithfully for three centuries, while our borderlands were always an apple of discord between Lithuania and Moscow. Our estate slowly fell into decay, yet we still remained their masters. However, recently the Moscow Tsar gave it to one of his nobles.
str_npc10_backstory_b|I came here on the invitation of Prince Radziwill. First I served in his body-guard regiments, then in an infantry party. We distinguished ourselves on the field of battle. The Prince even considered giving me command of a regiment...
str_npc11_backstory_b|I am the lord of the Nogai Horde, Mirza Nogai. The blood of the majestic Gengis Khan flows through my veins, and my ancestors were associated with the Tsars of Moscow. You cannot imagine how deeply it offends me to see the low-born Giray ruling the Crimean Khanate! I even have pay them a tribute! -- What an insult!
str_npc12_backstory_b|The Frenchman was certainly talkative. While I was treating him... my what stories he told! About cherry-trees under Pereyaslav which would grow only up to the waist, and of the crayfish in the Ukrainian rivers nigh the size of a cat! And that the Tatar children are born blind like puppies, and only open their eyes on the second week... Among other stories, Beauplan told me that the Sich Cossacks treat fever by mixing vodka with gunpowder...
str_npc13_backstory_b|I can make love-potions, tell the future, and use sorcery to invoke fortune in battle. I am also good at soothsaying and healing horses.
str_npc14_backstory_b|My name is Ingri, and I hail from Reval. If you need provisions for amazing prices, or you wish to sell your merchandise at triple the standard prices, then I am your woman! I provided all the food and wine for the court regiment of Carl Gustaf himself -- and everyone was perfectly content with me. Except my competitors, of course! And one day those bastards changed one of my beer barrels, and my clients were treated to horse piss instead of beer -- on the King's birthday no less! Bad luck all around, what can one say. Now I have no patent, and no savings either. Free as a bird, like it or not.
str_npc15_backstory_b|After he developed a passion for mead, my late husband began to beat me. Often he would come home blind drunk, and then go right for the belt... Well, one day I couldn't take it any longer. When he appeared, I was busy with dough in the kitchen, working my tired hands... So I gave him a blow on top of his head with my rolling-pin -- and broke his skull. 
str_npc16_backstory_b|I was born in Kafa. When I reached the age of fourteen, I was taken from my parents, brought to Istanbul and trained as a guard. At eighteen, I became the bodyguard of the Sultan's beloved wife. Yet soon my charge must have somehow offended the master. The eunuchs strangled her. After that, I was returned to Kafa. Not to my home, though -- to the slave market, where I was sold.
str_npc1_backstory_c|I see you prepare for war. And if you call me to your side, only should feet would grow into the ground like roots, would I not go. Even then I'd tear those roots from the ground! I have a mighty thirst for Swedish meat once more, like a wolf thirsting for a lamb! Oh, aren't they scoundrels! Fleas must've gotten into their tiny stockings and bitten their legs, so they can't sit still at home and keep intruding on lands which are not theirs...
str_npc2_backstory_c|Several years ago, Hmelnitski's army laid siege to Kamenets. Soon a plague hit the Cossack camp, and they withdrew. But the same dreadful epidemic took the lives of many townsmen, including my parents. I volunteered to be the captain of the town guard, and could only visit their graves after sunset, so busy was I. The graveyard keeper spoke of it in a pub, and invented a few tall tales involving grave digging. The merchants, their minds inflamed by the war and the plague, accused me of mortal sins, and bent themselves on my destruction. All I could take as I fled the city were my sword and a treatise on the art of war.
str_npc3_backstory_c|Learning of this, the bishop sent a mercenary band to deal with me. I did not wait for them to come, but took my belongings and fled to the woods. Soon I found out I had been defrocked and excommunicated by the bishop.
str_npc4_backstory_c|But when I returned home, I saw that all changed in the Sich.
str_npc5_backstory_c|Our regiment was given leave in a prosperous town of Great Poland. We soldiers of His Majesty, King Carl, allowed ourselves to relax a little. And the tale that I sold my halberd to a trader is but a blatant lie! I mean, I can recall no such thing... Morning come, and word of it came to the regiment commander, and he relieved me of my soldier's patent. Yet I have not abandoned hope to re-enlist. I already prepared a petition, which I shall personally deliver to King Karl. However, the quarters of our august monarch moves with the army, and I squandered almost all my savings chasing after it.
str_npc6_backstory_c|There was nothing I could do... My fate was to end up in a jail, and my wife would go straight into that clerk's bedroom. So I took my grandfather's pole-axe, went to the clerk's homestead and put him down like a pig. And my wife, Nastasia, I sent away in secret to Astrakhan, to distant relatives.
str_npc7_backstory_c|But I do not count myself unlucky, stranger, no more than any other woman, in this fetid backwater, this dung heap among the nations, populated by apes and jackals.
str_npc8_backstory_c|The old vizier was retired. I cried as I strangled him with a silk thread. The new vizier was a miser, quite like your everyday Istanbul shroff! He decided that the executioner needs no assistant, so I was put out of the palace the very same day. Now I make my bread as I can. Working as an assistant in the butcher's row at the markets, chopping up the carcass at the slaughterhouse. I even went as low as accepting a job killing a pig at a Cossack homestead -- for ten thaler! Shaitan damn that beast, cursed by the Allah...
str_npc9_backstory_c|All I have left is my grandfather's sword and my knightly honor.
str_npc10_backstory_c|As the French say, сherchez la femme. I met a beautiful Kiev pani around here, so I left service at once and took a mansion for rent, where we wiled away our days. Three months went by in an instant. But then my money ran out, and the master put me out of the mansion -- and the pani quickly went off with a fur trader who was happening by.
str_npc11_backstory_c|I grew tired of this humiliation, so I drove the Khan's tax collectors from my door. Two weeks later, a large force arrived on our steppes along the Dniepr near Perekop. I had no choice but to flee.
str_npc12_backstory_c|The next day I was called to a sick Cossack colonel in Kurenevka, and I gave him that very treatment. The poor chap guzzled down the cure, and cried out like mad -- for the whole day, until he died in the evening. The nitre in the powder had burned his intestines.^The people of Kurenevka learned of this, and sent almost a full regiment after me, threatening to put my skin on a drum.
str_npc13_backstory_c|As for me, I come from Poltava. My life would have been all right, save for that unfortunate cattle plague last Autumn. The local priest had long nursed a grudge against me -- suspected that I was stealing his parish from him, or some such nonsense. Accused me of witchcraft, and said it was I who killed the cattle. That very night they tarred and burned my house. Thankfully, some kind souls warned me in time, and I escaped with my life.
str_npc14_backstory_c|Now I am looking for a commander who could appreciate my true worth.
str_npc15_backstory_c|Oh, what trouble there was then! The guards came and wanted to bring me before the judges. I was so enraged I was beside myself. I grabbed a long-handle axe from one of the guards and drove the lot of them into the Volkhov River, right up to their necks. Then I ran off here to my sisters' place... She used to live here, but a week ago she passed away.
str_npc16_backstory_c|But they forgot who they were dealing with. On the second night I slaughtered all the guards and vanished into the night.
str_npc1_backstory_later|Even though I am hoary with age, I am still full of strength. You must take me with you, truly you must!
str_npc2_backstory_later|I am a noble and have much war experience, but in my distress I have taken many jobs -- a guard for merchants, the night watch at a noble house -- and I have even fed myself by winning at cards. But perhaps you yourself are in need of a companion?
str_npc3_backstory_later|So now I am wondering where life shall lead...
str_npc4_backstory_later|Now I am looking for some daring lads who might teach the Poles a good lesson...
str_npc5_backstory_later|I wonder if you need a veteran free lance in your party?
str_npc6_backstory_later|Now I am looking for companions on my way.
str_npc7_backstory_later|There can be no return home for me, so I look for any business I can find.
str_npc8_backstory_later|An executioner in retirement has many foes. I can hardly explain to the relatives of the deceased that it was merely my job. And with such a name as mine, try finding a new job, ha ha! But if you need a man who has mastered well both the axe and the noose, then I am at your service.
str_npc9_backstory_later|I am ready to follow he who fights for the just cause.
str_npc10_backstory_later|Now here I sit, as I have for days now. Frittering away the last of my money.
str_npc11_backstory_later|I've done much in my life. A rare commander it would be, who would agree to take on an old man like me, even if I am worth a dozen men on the battlefield.
str_npc12_backstory_later|Now, naturally, I am searching for a trusty patron -- one whom I might relieve of any illness.
str_npc13_backstory_later|But now I am left without a roof over my head, and I scrape by, fortune-telling on the road. But wandering the lonely roads is no good business for a young girl.
str_npc14_backstory_later|By the way, {sir/madam}, perhaps you are in need of a quartermaster with some experience? When the carts are brimming with provisions, the barrels are full of good powder, and a merry bottle-o-wine is always there for the day of rest -- well, the war goes much better, believe you me.
str_npc15_backstory_later|Now I'm sitting here and thinking where to go.
str_npc16_backstory_later|Now I'm looking for a good {man/lady} who is in need of a trusted guard.
str_npc1_backstory_response_1|I have long dreamt of having a famous warrior for counsel.
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|Well, a sharp blade is never out of place in my party.
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|A priest, even a defrocked priest, would be a welcome addition to the party.
str_npc4_backstory_response_1|Come with me. I promise no easy life, but I can promise vodka and the spoils of war.
str_npc5_backstory_response_1|A soldier who fought under Torstenson himself can indeed be of use to me...
str_npc6_backstory_response_1|Follow me. I cannot promise you a horse with horns, but we shall have plenty of other game.
str_npc7_backstory_response_1|A sober soldier? Well, that's exactly what I need.
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|Well, I do need fine swordsmen in my party...
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Well, if so -- you're welcome to join me.
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|Would you perhaps want to join me?
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|I would be glad to accept you in my party, if you would be willing to ride with me.
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|In fact I do need a doctor for the party. Please, join me.
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you wish to prove your talents under my command?
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|Well, you would not be out of place in my party.
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|So, you say you crushed your husband's skull with a rolling-pin and drove off three guards with a halberd?
str_npc16_backstory_response_1|You could be very useful in my party.
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|I would be glad to accept you, but not yet. Please wait just a little while.
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|I am not looking for companions.
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|Nay, I'm fed up with talking to you.
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|I would presume such a famous warrior would not accept me as commander.
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|You should return to the Swedish army. We do not walk the same path.
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|A sad tale. But I have heard the likes of it before. Farewell!
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|The Cossacks say: "A thin fellow is either a sick man or a poor man". So I hope you understand...
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|Sorry, but I have no need for an executioner. Ask someone else.
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Every man determines for himself what is their just cause. I believe I am not the best companion for you.
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|My advice would be to return to service.
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Perhaps you should find yourself a new Horde, then...
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Oh no, friend! You might poison me too!
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|I have always thought that sorcerers were liars. It seems to me that you got what you deserved.
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|I fear I do not have enough in my purse to pay for all your fine talents. So my answer must be no.
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|My, my. I pity whoever gets mixed up with you.
str_npc16_backstory_response_2|It sounds like you might be more trouble than you're worth.
str_npc1_signup|Excellent, then. Let us dine and then make our way!
str_npc2_signup|I hope you will forgive me if I will not join you at the table. I already had my supper, and I never dine afterwards.
str_npc3_signup|I accept this offer with pleasure, {my son/dear}! I swear by Sweet Mary Mother of God, you shall not regret it.
str_npc4_signup|Very well. As you wish.
str_npc5_signup|Very well. But know that I am not only a good marksman and pikeman... I also manage prisoners well, and can help with collecting war trophies.
str_npc6_signup|I have nowhere to go. Few would dare hire a runaway marksman. I would be glad to follow you. You know, I can hit a squirrel's eye with an arrow, and I can read trails like no one else.
str_npc7_signup|Thank you, {sir/madam}. This is good cause to drink a couple of mugs of fine kvass...
str_npc8_signup|Allah is merciful, for he has sent a kind master to me. By the way, it would be nice to have a good lunch. Without pork, of course!
str_npc9_signup|Thank you. I have led squadrons into battle, and I can be your right arm during a fight. And I can wield the pike like nobody can!
str_npc10_signup|Of course! I swear you shall never regret this. I will train your soldiers day and night! I will make true warriors of them!
str_npc11_signup|I was born in the saddle. I am a master of the sword, and I can easily track my way through a steppe.
str_npc12_signup|I am most grateful. I can not only heal fever and apply leeches. I can also dress battle wounds!
str_npc13_signup|You offer me a place by your side? Very well, I accept.
str_npc14_signup|Very well, I agree to follow you. Now I will take into my hands the matters of selling and buying. -- And I am not only good at trading, but I can hold a blade as well. The carts often need to be protected, as I'm sure you know...
str_npc15_signup|I am quiet as a mouse when I am calm. But if I am angry, I can crush anyone with my bare hands. Take me with you, good {sir/lady}. I can cook pies as well!
str_npc16_signup|I am ready to follow you even into Shaitan's jaws. I am adept at using the knife -- and an excellent marksman.
str_npc1_signup_2|Just remember this: soldiers must be well-fed and well-paid at all times.
str_npc2_signup_2|I wield the sword with great skill, and I have mastered battle tactics through long study. In addition, I can do bloodletting in the case of a sickness.
str_npc3_signup_2|Church services is not my only trade. I wield a pike quite well, and if you should ever need to persuade someone, I can do it even if it's a dead body. I do detest cowards, however...
str_npc4_signup_2|Just keep in mind, ever since I was taken prisoner, I cannot stand commanders who run away from the field of battle.
str_npc5_signup_2|Just keep in mind, in the Swedish army we are accustomed to regular meals and timely pay. And I shall not fight against my own nation, either. I do hope you understand.
str_npc6_signup_2|I hope you are an honest warrior, and not some rogue. I have seen much in my days of service, and I shall not suffer innocents to be harmed.
str_npc7_signup_2|Just keep in mind, I would not stand being dishonored by my commander.
str_npc8_signup_2|Timely food is the best way to secure loyalty, yes. And I try to keep away from all these women... Ungodly creatures are they!
str_npc9_signup_2|Just so as long as our party does not fail to maintain knightly honor, I am content. Honor is the first thought of a Lithuanian noble, even a penniless one.
str_npc10_signup_2|So as long as our party is strong and united, I am with you. But I can tolerate no misconduct -- and debts and or untimely pay!
str_npc11_signup_2|Just remember, we had better not meet any Crimeans.
str_npc12_signup_2|Just note one thing... I am of the simple folk, and I have no love for those masters who would earn their fortune by robbing the ordinary folks...
str_npc13_signup_2|My craft forbids me killing people -- except in self-defense. Yet in all things peaceful I am useful like no other.
str_npc14_signup_2|Better there be no other women around. Else there's a life of constant squabbles.
str_npc15_signup_2|All in all, if you need something done about the household, call me.
str_npc16_signup_2|One thing I can't stand is cowardice and dishonor.
str_npc1_signup_response_1|I never skimp on provisions, old man. Worry not.
str_npc2_signup_response_1|Well then, you are welcome to join my men.
str_npc3_signup_response_1|I hope your quick tongue will be of use to us.
str_npc4_signup_response_1|I am agreed with you there. Let's have a toast -- I'm buying! And ready your stuff, we set out shortly.
str_npc5_signup_response_1|Very well. Prepare yourself for a journey, free lance. Let us see what you're worth.
str_npc6_signup_response_1|Exactly the man I need. After dinner we shall set out.
str_npc7_signup_response_1|Have your kvass, young man, and do not be troubled.
str_npc8_signup_response_1|Do your job and worry not about your meals.
str_npc9_signup_response_1|I am glad we understand each other.
str_npc10_signup_response_1|Such a helper would be of use to me!
str_npc11_signup_response_1|Well, Nogai, consider yourself enlisted.
str_npc12_signup_response_1|I always do as honor demands. Come now, prepare for the journey.
str_npc13_signup_response_1|I hope you can cook up some luck for us.
str_npc14_signup_response_1|I think you may get along with my companions. Gather yourself.
str_npc15_signup_response_1|Pies you say? I feel you might be more useful on the battlefield than in the kitchen.
str_npc16_signup_response_1|Well, gather yourself. We set out soon.
str_npc1_signup_response_2|War tightens our belts oftentimes. So, no, sorry...
str_npc2_signup_response_2|Travel with Dracula's offspring? No thanks.
str_npc3_signup_response_2|If you wish to join an army, you should take off your robes and your cross, and put on a cuirass. Perhaps we shall talk again once you have made up your mind.
str_npc4_signup_response_2|You can win a war even if you lose a battle. Look for another companion.
str_npc5_signup_response_2|You must be mistaken, free lance. This is no royal regiment that I command.
str_npc6_signup_response_2|In war, the line between robbery and feats of arms is often blurred. 'Tis better we should part ways now.
str_npc7_signup_response_2|A moralist abstainer? We do not spend our days praying to God. We make our living by making war.
str_npc8_signup_response_2|Woman-hater, executioner, and a glutton as well... I fear our ways must part.
str_npc9_signup_response_2|I think you might not get along so well with my lads. So long!
str_npc10_signup_response_2|I fear a devil like you would just scare off all my mercenaries.
str_npc11_signup_response_2|It is dangerous to have you with me. I wish no trouble with the Tatars.
str_npc12_signup_response_2|And what else are serfs for? Nay, I need no rebels among my men.
str_npc13_signup_response_2|A pacifist in a party is more dangerous than a cuirassier regiment.
str_npc14_signup_response_2|Hell no. I need no thievish female women-haters.
str_npc15_signup_response_2|There was a woman, a warrior in France once upon a time, Joan of Arc. She came to a bad end...
str_npc16_signup_response_2|A bodyguard with a strong sense of decency? Sounds a bit silly, don't you think?
str_npc1_payment|I will be very useful to you, {sir/madame}, you can bet on that. Just one more thing before we leave, would you mind lending me {reg3} denars? I am ashamed to admit it, but I am in a bit debt at the moment. I've stayed in this tavern for a few weeks and the tavern owners no longer believe I am as loaded with gold as I said I was. You know, things could get ugly here if they see me leaving with you before paying them. changed
str_npc2_payment|With pleasure. Just one plea - last night I was somewhat unlucky at a game table. Could you pay my debt? The sum is pitiful, merely {reg3} thaler. But with this I can leave the town with a clean conscience.
str_npc3_payment|.
str_npc4_payment|Just a minor note -- I have a small debt to the innkeeper. Last night I went on a spree, offered drinks to all in the inn. Then we brawled with some visiting Poles... Could you perhaps buy out my debt? It's only {reg3} thaler.
str_npc5_payment|And one more thing. After I lost all my possessions, I had to sell my cuirass. Could you afford me {reg3} thaler in advance, that I might pay back to the usurer? Without a cuirass in battle, I would be worth little more than a turtle without a shell.
str_npc6_payment|Yes, but there's a small problem. My wife remains penniless. If you could give me {reg3} thaler, that I could send to her for her needs, I would go with you straight away. Otherwise I shall have to become a brigand to raise the money.
str_npc7_payment|I am ready. Just one small request, give me {reg3} thaler for a new coat. Mine is worn out, I wouldn't want to travel looking so... unpresentable.
str_npc8_payment|My axe shall serve you well, aye. Of course, if you give me {reg3} thaler to pay for a new handle. I have worked for a full month at the local slaughterhouse, and the axe has been worn out.
str_npc9_payment|It is a pleasure to deal with you, {sir/madam}. But I have a small request. I need to raise {reg3} thaler urgently, to buy a family tree which was composed and sealed by the stamp of a King of Arms, whom I met along the way by miraculous chance, nothing less. With such a parchment in my hands, I could quite well reclaim my lands...
str_npc10_payment|This is most welcome news! And since we're in this together, might I ask of you a small favor? A mere {reg3} thaler -- this is how much the local jeweler asks for a ring, which I wish to send to my pani. Perhaps she will return to me once she receives it.
str_npc11_payment|Allahu Akbar! Please give me {reg3} thaler for a new saddle.
str_npc12_payment|{Sir/Madam}, I would only like to settle some formalities, a little advance, so to speak -- just {reg3} thaler.
str_npc13_payment|Now that we have an agreement, dare I ask of you a small favor? My distant relative who resides here offered me a place to stay. Could you give me {reg3} thaler so that I could repay her for all the good she's done for me?
str_npc14_payment|Just a small nuisance, though. There was a fair here the other day, and I sold some wine to a small party, without permission from the local trade guild. Until I pay their fine of {reg3} thaler, the guards will not let me leave town.
str_npc15_payment|Oh, what joy! Kind {sir/lady}, can you not spare a mere {reg3} thaler for some new Moroccan shoes? -- I can't go anywhere in these foot-wraps.
str_npc16_payment|Thank you! But first, please give me {reg3} thaler. I have found an excellent undercloth chain armor. Without proper armor, what sort of a bodyguard would I be?
str_npc1_payment_response|Alright. 
str_npc2_payment_response|Here's {reg3} thaler.
str_npc3_payment_response|Alright. 
str_npc4_payment_response|Why would you even ask. Here's {reg3} thaler.
str_npc5_payment_response|There's {reg3} thaler in this purse. I hope you will work off this lone with your loyal service.
str_npc6_payment_response|Family must go first. Here, take the money.
str_npc7_payment_response|Of course. Take the money.
str_npc8_payment_response|Here, count it twice.
str_npc9_payment_response|For a noble, one's family tree is everything. Take the money, you're welcome to it.
str_npc10_payment_response|Here is {reg3} thaler, but I don't think it's a worthwhile investment.
str_npc11_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} thaler.
str_npc12_payment_response|Well, I should expect you to serve me hand and foot for this. Here, take it.
str_npc13_payment_response|No one is safe from poverty or prison, as they say. Here, take the money.
str_npc14_payment_response|Here, take it. I feel this investment will soon be well repaid.
str_npc15_payment_response|All right, take it. I am glad to have you with us.
str_npc16_payment_response|If you need it, then you need it. Here, {reg3} thaler.
str_npc1_morality_speech|Listen up, {son/my dear}! I warned you all right, I have no love for {s21}!
str_npc2_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, but do I dislike {s21}. It is not worthy of a noble.
str_npc3_morality_speech|Unbearable! Again {s21}. How long shall we endure it?
str_npc4_morality_speech|Hey Cossack, {s21} is a shame for any Sich dweller. Next time you had better think before doing something like this.
str_npc5_morality_speech|We have to {s21}? How unexpected. Caring for soldiers should come first.
str_npc6_morality_speech|You ordered {s21}! I simply cannot accept this!
str_npc7_morality_speech|So, {s21}? I am deeply shaken.
str_npc8_morality_speech|Ah, {s21}, shaitan take me! Even my guts rise up against it.
str_npc9_morality_speech|Oh, {s21} is a disgrace for me. I will not render such service.
str_npc10_morality_speech|For me {s21} means dishonor. A commander who would allow it could never gain my trust.
str_npc11_morality_speech|We are warriors, we should not {s21}. Otherwise we shall soon lose all our soldiers.
str_npc12_morality_speech|Commander, {sir/madam}, I am a doctor and I cannot idly stand by while you {s21}. Have mercy on these simple men!
str_npc13_morality_speech|Listen now, {s21} cannot be good for a man who I trust with my life. Do not allow it any further! Do not tempt your fortune.
str_npc14_morality_speech|I am a quartermaster and I cannot allow {s21}. Try to avoid it in the future.
str_npc15_morality_speech|Here's what I say -- {s21} is a sin. If it continues, I know not what I shall do...
str_npc16_morality_speech|Master, I warned you nothing offends me more than {s21}. I hope it never happens again.
str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|It's {s21} again! Hell no, this cannot stand!
str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|You decided to {s21}. If this continues, we shall have to part ways.
str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|Oh well, {s21}. I do not approve of that.
str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Glory and honor come first! And you, you decided to {s21}, may you burn in hell!
str_npc5_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc6_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc7_2ary_morality_speech|I consider {s21} unacceptable. If it continues, I shall find myself another commander.
str_npc8_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc11_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc12_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc13_2ary_morality_speech|You can allow {s21} with ease? I fear we will not get along so well.
str_npc14_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc16_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|Here's what, {son/my dear}! Since that damned thievish {s11} is with us, I cannot be in peace. He pretends to be a saint, but in truth he is a thief and a swindler.
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|I cannot stand it any longer. That unfrocked monk {s11} stalks me all the time. I don't know what he's up to, but each night he draws a circle with chalk and prays inside of it, while he looks at me strangely. And the other day he tried to splash me with holy water...
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|Here's what I say, commander. That old {s11} is a cruel man. I can't even take a step without him accusing me of all manner of deadly sins.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|Listen, friend. I suspect {s11}. His story about fleeing from Moscow is an obvious fabrication. I swear by my cross, he is spying on us, under the guise of sending letters to Astrakhan.
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|Allow me to speak, {herr/dame} {playername}! I must note that this {s11} is rather suspicious. He does not enjoy the sunlight, wanders about the camp at night, and behaves strangely in general.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|Allow me to speak! I do not like that {s11} with his hangman's habits. The very thought that I might have landed in the hands of his ilk, had I not fled Moscow... It sends shivers through me.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I can no longer be silent. The presence of that old {s11} is more and more unbearable each day. Learning that I cannot stand even the smell of spirits, he always tries to breathe into my face. And he stinks like an ale-barrel.
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|Listen, aga! {s11}-hanum is a dreadful women, I swear by Allah. She killed her husband, and now I feel she put her evil eyes on me.
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|{playername}! I would like to say that {s11} is not the best of company. He refers to my homeland of Bryansk as native Russian lands, while any man with a hint of education knows they have always been part of Lithuania!
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|Pardon me, but for how long must I bear the presence of that uncouth Swede? {s11} is no traveling companion -- indeed, he is nothing more than a servant. And if you ask him of a small favor, he puffs himself up like some kind of peacock!
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|That boy is driving me crazy! Yes, that {s11}. Not a day passes without him getting underfoot.
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|I have tried to constrain myself, good commander, but {s11} drives me to despair. In his eyes I am but a serf, a bondsman with no right to even raise my eyes to him.
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|If {s11} cannot stop looking at me as if I were some tavern wench, I shall make some ill charms for him. Of that you can be sure.
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|{Sir/Madam}, let me make this plan. I do not appreciate that noble who thinks of me as of a pile of dirt on the road, or something stuck to his oh-so-noble boot. Yes, I am referring to {s11}. I am an army quartermaster, not some serf wench!
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|Forgive this poor wife speaking out, but tell me please, why is it you took a vampire in our party? Of course, I'm talking about {s11} -- who else? He's just like in my grandmother's fairytales.
str_npc16_personalityclash_speech|Oh, master! I can bear much, but not a witch in the party. The shaman tricks of that {s11} are not to my liking -- not at all.
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|If that {s11} tries preaching to me one more time, I swear I will beat him black and blue, just like any gentryman should!
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|I respect religious feelings, but this has become absurd!
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|His scabrous jokes about me make the unwashed soldiery laugh. I shall not be able to tolerate this forever.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|I am sure he is a spy. And shall you tolerate his presence any further, you shall have to choose: him or me!
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|Once I awoke and saw his pale face and teeth above me. I do not enjoy standing under the same banner as a vampire.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|Walking side by side with this monster is more dreadful by the day. I am not the timid type, but it is a haunting thing to have a hangman behind one's back.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|All the time he yells Polish his songs and the like, and calls the Tsar's warlords cowards and bandits. My patience has reached its limit!
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|What did I say, anyway? It was meant as a compliment. I merely remarked that in my harem she would be the third or even the second wife! What is wrong with these Russian women!?
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech_b|If he persists, this will end with a duel quite surely.
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech_b|Discipline is based on strict subordination. Pardon me, but I have no love for familiarity.
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech_b|The worst part is that he constantly yells at me in battle, telling me what I should do. Thanks to him, my good yesir, good captives were lost! Teach him to behave, oh Mirza, or I shall do so myself.
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech_b|But I am a member of our party just like he! Oh, what a noble he is, with not even a single plot of arable land. I can no longer stand this humiliation!
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech_b|I am an upright girl and shall not stand the rudeness of soldiers.
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech_b|If he once more throws me his coat, muttering through his teeth that "it must be clean by morning", I'm afraid I shall simply have to look for another company.
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech_b|Perhaps he is a good warrior, but so what? When he wanders about in the night, my heart fills with terror. And I am not alone in that feeling... You have a decision to make...
str_npc16_personalityclash_speech_b|The other day she came and offered me a luck charm. To me -- a Muslim! When the Allah damns the infidels to death..
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech|There's a troublemaking Cossack in the party. You know who I mean -- {s11}. That one is a hundred times more trouble than he's worth. If he's to stay with us any longer, then I shall have to bid you farewell, {son/my dear}.
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|Perhaps I speak out of turn, {sir/madam}, but that {s11} is truly a witch. I met her at the cemetery the night when the moon was bright. She was gathering some roots. I fear to think what she's going to brew with them...
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|Virgin Mary be my witness, the Cossack {s11} is verily a devil-spawn! I mean this quite apart from his hatred of us upright Catholics. I have seen much, but never have I witnessed a man who can drink a full bottle of vodka in the morning and then wander around the camp looking for a brawl... Aye, that I have seen for the first time in my life.
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|I can't get it, eh -- that {s11} never so much as touches vodka! What sort of a knight from hell is he then?
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech|{Herr Kommandant/Kommandantin} , forgive me for being frank -- but that Lithuanian parvenu {s11} gives me no peace. He imagines himself an officer and demands I be his servant.
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|You know what, {sir/madam}!? I am a straightforward man and I shall be frank. We should not drag that witch around with us. We don't need {s11} with her potions, charms and magic.
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, hear me. {s11} has turned my life to hell. First she started patronizing me, then called me her son, and tried to enter my tent during the night.
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech|And one more thing, {playername}-aga! Your guard, {s11}, took a dislike to me from the first day. I always expecting some dirty trick from her.
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech|{s11}! He took the best place right under my nose and did not even apologize! If that Tatar cannot learn to behave like a man of culture, I shall teach him a lesson!
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech|{s11} is a dangerous man. He is as good a doctor as I would be the Patriarch of Jerusalem. What is he doing in our party anyway?
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech|{s11} is a spy for the Giray! She was sent to assassinate me, surely.
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech|I would be content and have no complaints, were it not for {s11}. The witch hates me. She complains that I remind her of her late husband...
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech|I am patient, but even I have my limits. This {s11} has apparently mistaken me for that pani who so boldly turned him round her finger. His courting and insinuations are offensive to me.
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech|Tell me honestly, why do we keep that quack in the party? {s11} is a fraud and a good-for-nothing. His concoctions make my belly hurt, and if he shows those awful leeches to me one more time, I shall feed them to him on the spot...
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech|Oh well, I can no longer stand it. That {s11}, the heathen merchant, bought rotten meat and withered vegetables again. How am I supposed to make a lunch of that?
str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech|{s11} is a parvenu with crazy ideas of an independent Nogai Khanate. Believe me, he will only bring trouble down on our heads.
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech_b|He always guzzles down the vodka and sets his mind to thinking whom he should rob...
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech_b|Perhaps you want to ask what I was doing on the cemetery late at night? I was just walking by. Note that if you continue to keep the company of a witch, I shall have to leave your party.
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech_b|In our last fight he almost got me killed, confusing me for the enemy. And his yells at me -- "Damned schismatic!" I come from an old gentry house of Spasokukotskis, and I shall not suffer some serf to mock me.
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech_b|Pardon me, but if the lads see me in the same company with that milksop, I will be laughed at by the entire Sich.
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech_b|I am a Swedish free lance, and I answer only to he who pays my wages. My sword is for sale, but not my honor. If this continues, I shall have to part ways with you.
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech_b|Yesterday she gave everyone a potion "against bullets". I did not drink it, but went to a nearby church and lit a candle. If this continues, I fear I shall run out of candles.
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|A few days ago she got angry with me for some reason. Called me an insensitive blockhead and an ungrateful fool. A few more nights like this and I shall go look for new companions.
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech_b|Certainly, my last job hardly earns me respect among my fellow countrymen, but she might cut me down like a sheep at any moment!
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech_b|Worse yet, during battle he only thinks of taking prisoners, and not of the tasks before him. You only hear him saying "yesir, yesir". He shall turn our company into nothing more than a Horde.
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech_b|Keep a close eye on him, or I may not remain in your company.
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech_b|She had better keep her distance, or you shall have to choose -- her or me!
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech_b|When she takes up her weapon, it sends shivers down my spine. I cannot get it out of my head these days.
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech_b|And if he thinks that a lonely girl would be silent while he tells his scabrous jokes -- well, he is quite mistaken.
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech_b|In your place, {sir/madam}, I would long ago shown him the door. I hope you will do so now, or I shall have to begin my search for another master.
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech_b|Here's what I say. Two mistresses should never stand at the same oven. You are no Tatar, to have four wives or the like. So if she continues to stick her nose in all the household business...
str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech_b|Turn your head, and I shall send his spirit to the Grey Steppe to meet his ancestors. My patience is at end.
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|I like that {s11}. He's a heathen hangman all right, but he's brave in a fight, and knows how to show his respect.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|Let me just say that I wish there were more warriors like {s11} in our company! He is a very educated man, and knows all about bloodletting.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|I just wanted to say that {s11} is the finest man in the entire company, even though he is a Muslim.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|I must say this -- {s11} is a lovely girl! I gave her a pinch the other day, and she beat me with a halter so violently that I had to run away...
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|To be frank, if there is an upright man amongst us, it is surely {s11}. Even though I am a Lutheran, I consider him a holy father. Especially after that communion when him, when he and I finished off a wood-o-wine full of good Tokay.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|{Sir/Madam}, I feel myself healthy and fresh. Recently {s11} applied his leeches to me. That doctor is worthy of respect and honor.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|Pardon me, captain, if I'm sticking my nose into what is no business of mine, but I want you to know something -- {s11} is a true warrior and friend!
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|Whatever they say, Tatars and Cossacks are brothers indeed! Last night, me and {s11} were returning from the inn with arms round each other, singing songs. He sang the Cossack songs, while I sung the Tatar ones. A fine night it was! -- The villagers ran out in their nightclothes to listen to us.
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|Blessed be the day when {s11} arrived in our company! Food, water and... other joys of army service. This means a lot for true military men.
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|That {s11} is no craven, and certainly has no fear of blood.
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|We Nogai have always thought highly of Ukrainian girls. They make the best wives and concubines. And our {s11} is a true gem! Once I make the Nogai independent and become Khan, that very day I shall take her as my wife. My beloved wife.
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|By the way, {s11} is a great fellow. He never boasts about his family grandeur like some do, and he's always ready to lend a hand to a comrade.
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|I would have left you a long time ago, were it not for {s11}. The old man has taken the place of my late father. He's the only one I can feel safe with!
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|{Sir/Madam}, it is said there can be no friendship between women. But let me say this -- I can always count on {s11}. She cured all my cart horses and prepared a broth for me to cast out a fever. I was back on my feet the very next day.
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|Who's that rider there? Perhaps it is {s11} returning from the round? Oh, I can't speak badly of him -- he's a delicate and courteous gentleman. And he always praises my cooking, and... well, he is very kind, you know...
str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech|{s11} -- now he's a true warrior. His jokes may be crude and his habits plain, but he can fight like no other!
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|And if I'm sentenced to death someday, I hope he's the one holding the axe.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|Just lately his knowledge of medicine saved my life.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|It's strange, but we quickly found common ground. If only I could turn him to Christianity, the Bishop would surely give me back my frock.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|And my how thrifty she is! Never mind she's from Novgorod, her dumpling soup is so good the plates are licked clean. You were right to take her into our ranks.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|Our holy father is also quite useful in battle, as you have no doubt noticed. Last time he yelled such swears and curses that the enemy's horses lost their speed.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|The balm he applied to my wounds after the fight healed them in but a few days. I am glad we have this man of wisdom in our company.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|He seemed haughty at first, but now I can see that he is a man one can always rely on.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|You mean to say Allah forbids drinking wine? That is so, but {s11} has well mastered the ways of religion. He explained that nothing in the Koran forbids the drinking vodka...
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech_b|Our quartermaster is always up to the mark. God knows, were she not of simple folk, I would have offered her my hand and heart. A better housekeeper for my estate I could not find in the whole world.
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech_b|I tell you, he and I are unstoppable in a fight!
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech_b|If she is as skilled in amorous pleasures as she is in her shamanism, we would surely live a life of splendor!
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech_b|'Tis quite a shame he took the path of a warrior. He would have made a marvelous doctor.
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech_b|And it seems he has taken a fancy to me as well. I better go to the woods, and look for some herbs to heal his gout.
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech_b|I say that she is the worthiest among your followers. Make it known to all, that any man who lays a finger on her shall sup on rotten horse-flesh for the remainder of the journey.
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech_b|If you see him, tell him to hurry to lunch. I saved some delicacies for him. Were my husband that gallant and stately, I wouldn't have broken my rolling-pin on his head.
str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech_b|You should praise him highly, master, and reward him well for his deeds. That man never fails!
str_npc1_retirement_speech|Oh, {son/my dear}! My aching bones are telling me that my days of jumping around and swinging my blade have passed. I've got myself a little money, and I've a mind to buy a homestead where I shall meet my old age.
str_npc2_retirement_speech|{Sir/Madam}, I must speak out. Since the beginning, things have not gone as I had expected. Pardon me, but I have to leave you. I shall look for companions who would treat me well, and who have respect for my habits.
str_npc3_retirement_speech|Listen, commander! Last night I had a vision. Mother Mary said to go to Riga, visit the bishop there, and recant. He shall renounce his excommunication, and return me to the parish. It is not the first vision like this that I have had. I had better go...
str_npc4_retirement_speech|You see, lad, my brothers from the Don have planned a journey to Persia, to move some goods, and they called upon me to join them. Do not take this amiss, but I shall be going with them.
str_npc5_retirement_speech|Pardon me, {Herr Kommandant/Kommandantin}, but I must insist on canceling our agreement. The place of a soldier is not amongst mercenaries, but in the regular royal forces. May good fortune follow you, wherever your path takes you!
str_npc6_retirement_speech|Listen, {sir/my lady}. My heart is aching, and I am always worried about my wife, who is alone in foreign lands. Do not take it amiss, please, but I shall have to leave you for a while.
str_npc7_retirement_speech|Captain! Pardon me please, but I feel myself out of place lately. I shall have to look for another company, which would appreciate my true worth.
str_npc8_retirement_speech|Sorry, aga, but there is a situation... In a town nearby, a hangman retired of old age. Oh, if only you knew how I miss my job. At night I dream of the axe, the noose and the strangling silk wire. So I think I will head there and try to get the job I was meant for...
str_npc9_retirement_speech|{playername}, it is time we part ways. I heard war has flamed up in Bryansk, and I wish to head there, to try to recover my stolen lands. Thank you for everything, and remember me kindly.
str_npc10_retirement_speech|I won't beat about the bush. I'm a soldier of fortune, and things with you haven't looked good for quite a while now. Besides, I have been given a favorable offer. But I do hope I never meet you on the battlefield! Farewell.
str_npc11_retirement_speech|A herald arrives from the steppe, Mirza! The time has come! The Nogai Horde is ready to break free from the Turkish yoke. And I must be there to join them! Farewell!
str_npc12_retirement_speech|Well, the time has come for us to part ways, good commander. The locals have persuaded me to stay and heal them. I am grateful for your help and protection, and shall you have need of my leeches, you know where to find me.
str_npc13_retirement_speech|I am tired of these constant journeys and battles, {playername}! I will try to find myself a cozy nook where I can live in peace and devote myself to my trade. But before we part, I shall charm you, that you may enjoy fortune in battle.
str_npc14_retirement_speech|Pardon me, {sir/madam}, but my patience is at end. Your soldiers are gluttonous and ungrateful, and your companions are rude and uncouth. Besides, managing supplies without filling my own pocket is not worthy of my trade. Here is all the income and expenses written down. I hope we may part amicably, yes?
str_npc15_retirement_speech|Oh {sir/madam}, I cannot bear this wanderer's life much longer. We travel the fields and woods, like bears woken up in the winter. I feel must try to return home. Thank you for bread and salt, for refuge and for wisdom shared.
str_npc16_retirement_speech|Forgive me, but I can no longer faithfully protect you. Your companions and your deeds are unacceptable for me. So long. -- Perhaps we shall meet again.
str_npc1_rehire_speech|You know, {my son/my dear}, I may no longer be a young man, but the peaceful life does not feel right by me. All the moreso when there's enemies swarming all around! So if you should order a jug of merry wine brought for me, well, I would be glad to return under your command.
str_npc2_rehire_speech|I must admit you are the finest companion I have ever met. My leave was a great mistake.
str_npc3_rehire_speech|It is you, commander! Oh, the sacrist of the Riga Cathedral told me that believing dreams is a sin! The days I spent in the diocesan jail were dreadful. Anyway, you can fully count on me.
str_npc4_rehire_speech|Oh, commander! I knew in my heart that this journey I set out on would not bring me much good. My share of the goods is so small that I squandered it away in the first pub I passed. So if you'll have me back, I would be glad of it.
str_npc5_rehire_speech|{Herr/Dame} {playername}! A few weeks in a musketeer regiment have been enough for me to understand my mistake. Instead of fighting, we were square-bashing all day, and when I returned from a leave just a little bit drunk, I received ten days of incarceration. Sitting in the cold wet basement, I recalled our campaigns as some of the happiest times in my life. I already bought some parchment and wrote a new contract. Would you kindly sign it?
str_npc6_rehire_speech|I have found you at last! My wife is well, and I am ready to stand under your banner once more.
str_npc7_rehire_speech|Good day to you, captain. I was wrong when I thought of finding better companions. Would you mind if I join you again?
str_npc8_rehire_speech|I did not expect to see you here, aga. It turns out that only locals can work here as hangmen. So I wander about in search for odd jobs. Would you accept me back into your ranks?
str_npc9_rehire_speech|What can I say, {playername}... It seems that acquiring new lands under your command would be easier than returning to my old estates! I hope you don't mind us fighting under the same banner once more?
str_npc10_rehire_speech|It seems there's only tricksters and scoundrels in these parts! Their "favorable offer" was only favorable until the day came to pay wages! These coppers weren't even enough to purchase a new cross-belt. All in all, if you don't mind, I am quite ready to return to your company.
str_npc11_rehire_speech|Alas, Allah was not with us this time. We were defeated -- but our struggle for independence is not over. Please, take me back once more, if you still have need of me.
str_npc12_rehire_speech|With the scarce pay these villagers can offer me, I had almost given up. No, I am much better off serving as an army doctor. Would you accept me back?
str_npc13_rehire_speech|Well then, we meet again. You were right -- war is everywhere, and quiet places are in short supply in these land. I would prefer to be among friendly warriors.
str_npc14_rehire_speech|My good {sir/lady}! I am so glad to see you once more. The lot of a freelance quartermaster is a poor one. Armies have no need of suppliers: their commanders simply ransack all the settlements they come across on their way. Forget everything I said before, please. I forgive the foolish Swede. I may return to your company, I hope?
str_npc15_rehire_speech|Ah, {sir/madam}! There is no such thing as a happy life for a poor widow. My house was taken by the treasury on the orders of the warlord. I am a mere wanderer once more. Take me back, I beg you! -- I will serve you hand and foot.
str_npc16_rehire_speech|Since we parted, you have changed quite a bit. I hope not for the worse, but we shall see. You are taking me back, right?
str_npc1_home_intro|Wadowice! The lands of Great Poland, the lands of my childhood and my youth...
str_npc2_home_intro|Kamenets! I'll be damned if this is not the most beautiful place in the world.
str_npc3_home_intro|Krakov. The ancient capital of Poland. A city of great kings and zealous Catholics.
str_npc4_home_intro|I come from here, you know. My father served in the Korsun regiment.
str_npc5_home_intro|I was born and grew up in these lands.
str_npc6_home_intro|A covert, concealed place for a shelter, refuge -- or a prison. This is what the word Tula means. It is the name of my hometown.
str_npc7_home_intro|Ryazan, the first Russian city to fall under the onslaught of the Mongols. I come from these lands.
str_npc8_home_intro|Here, where the Don enters the sea of Azov, is my homeland.
str_npc9_home_intro|I hear the bells of Vilna! The ancient capital of Lithuania! Oh how many memories they call up...
str_npc10_home_intro|I know these lands! Once upon a time I had a jolly good battle here, when I first arrived in your domains.
str_npc11_home_intro|The steppe, the endless steppe... My dear lands.
str_npc12_home_intro|We are approaching Kiev!
str_npc13_home_intro|Poltava. The name of this place is unknown amongst men, yet my fortune telling predicts a great battle shall soon scar the place. But it shall also glorify my town, so it shall be known throughout all the world, and the best bards shall sing of it.
str_npc14_home_intro|A few more miles and we shall see the walls of Reval!
str_npc15_home_intro|This quiet forest stream is called Volkhov. From here it is but a short way to Novgorod.
str_npc16_home_intro|There, I can hear the roar of the surf. We shall soon see my town of Kafa.
str_npc1_home_description|This is the earth that gave birth to Poland. Our gentry is the most freedom-loving in God's great world. And our king has always been elected, and ruled as a first among equals.
str_npc2_home_description|From here it is not far to Valachia, my homeland. This city has always been on one border or another. Many armies have come, to feel the tar poured on them by the city's defenders... The tumen of Batu Khan, the regiments of Algirdas. Nalivaiko, Krivonos, Bogun -- and even Hmelnitski himself have laid siege there.
str_npc3_home_description|It was here, in 1386, that the Lithuanian Prince Jogaila was baptized. And later, his marriage with Queen Jadwiga laid the first stones in the union of Poland and Lithuania in our great Commonwealth.
str_npc4_home_description|Korsun was founded by Yaroslav the Wise himself, and of all the cities of Ukraine, is it perhaps second only to Chigirin.
str_npc5_home_description|Ah Vyborg, the great city of the Swedish crusaders, who arrived here in the XIII Century to bring the light of the Christian faith to the barbaric Karelian heathens. The first fortress here was erected in 1293 on the orders of king Tolhils Knutsen.
str_npc6_home_description|Half a century ago, Tula was captured by False Dmitry, who waited here for the fall of Moscow. Some three years later, another impostor arrived here, the Thief of Tushino.
str_npc7_home_description|The city today lies fifty verst away from the old town. Yet my homeland is right there.
str_npc8_home_description|This is Azaq-Kale, ancient Tana, which the Cossacks call Azov. My grandfather told me that our ancestors came from the Greeks who held the town. Even in these ancient days, they proudly bore the title of executioners!
str_npc9_home_description|Can you hear the wolves howling? It is a good sign. Old men say that the Lithuanian Prince Gediminas hunted in the lands and killed an auroch. As he lay sleeping after the hunt, he saw a giant iron wolf in his dream. The dream was prophetic -- soon the hill where the prince rested had become a mighty fortress.
str_npc10_home_description|My homeland is far, far away...
str_npc11_home_description|We, the descendants of the Ilkhan, came into the steppe not as refugees but as rightful rulers. Yet the Turkish Sultan preferred the Crimean Girays. Since that day we have lived as slaves.
str_npc12_home_description|That is a wonderful city! The years have taken their toll, but the capital of the Ancient Rus is even now the finest place on earth.
str_npc13_home_description|I know well these lands. They are of black earth, and the woods are full of prey. Kind people with an open heart live here. Had it not been for the war...
str_npc14_home_description|Reval, before it was taken by the Swedes, was a free town and part of the Hanseatic Union. My family used to reside there, even back in the times of the Livonian Order.
str_npc15_home_description|It is a large, rich city. I passed my childhood in the trading quarters.
str_npc16_home_description|My home city is a great trade center. Our goods are very special. Slaves require fine treatment and provisions, for their price is determined by how well they look.
str_npc1_home_description_2|If I should die, bury me in the quiet grove near my home village.
str_npc2_home_description_2|Together with other settlers, I have defended the city tower, from which I saw countless Cossack regiments surrounding the town. And this is how city dwellers repaid me...
str_npc3_home_description_2|That city is more than a homeland to me. Here one can feel the breath of antiquity...
str_npc4_home_description_2|A great battle there was, when Hmelnitski utterly crushed the gentry. In these days I was held captive by the Tatars.
str_npc5_home_description_2|My city is under the watchful eye of God. In September of 1495, the fortress of Vyborg was besieged by the regiments of Ivan the Third, the Tsar of Moscow. And just when the city was preparing to lower its flags and open the gates, a cross appeared in the skies. The siege army, fearing God's wrath, fled the city. Our family has passed this tale from generation to generation.
str_npc6_home_description_2|In these woods, my father taught me to be the master of the hounds. Later, after I mastered following hare trails and putting arrows through the squirrel's eye, I was sent to Moscow.
str_npc7_home_description_2|No matter if my town is small. We nobles of Ryazan are proud of our land and our forefathers!
str_npc8_home_description_2|Oh, how many men came here -- the Scythians, the Greeks, the Russians, the Pecheneg. And now this fortress remains the key to the Tauris.
str_npc9_home_description_2|There were times when the Princes of Vilna ruled all the lands from the North Sea to the Black Sea...
str_npc10_home_description_2|Let us talk about it some other day.
str_npc11_home_description_2|We have no towns, no halls and no forces. We are subdued, and pursue our meager lives in Bakhchisaray. Yet the glorious Nogai is my homeland. I shall fight for it to my final breath.
str_npc12_home_description_2|Were it not for the dreadful Kurenevka Cossacks, I would never have left my homestead in Podolsk. But fate never seems to ask my opinion... We are all blown in the wind. Even moreso, people who are masters of a trade like mine, which is so ungratefully received.
str_npc13_home_description_2|I do not blame the illiterate villagers for driving me out. Someday I shall return, and I shall stay.
str_npc14_home_description_2|For the dwellers of Reval, trade is the stuff of life. My father brought Russian hemp to England, and I -- well, I ran away and tagged along with the army.
str_npc15_home_description_2|I didn't like dolls and used to play skittles with the boys. As I grew up I learned to work with the oven. It was there I discovered that a rolling-pin in a strong hand is every bit as deadly as a blade.
str_npc16_home_description_2|Someday I shall return and open my own business. Slave trade is quite profitable, you know...
str_npc1_home_recap|I am of the great Polish gentry, and a relative to powerful magnates of the Polish Commonwealth.
str_npc2_home_recap|For many years my kin ruled Valachia, but I myself was born and grew up in Kamenets.
str_npc3_home_recap|My father is a minor landlord from the Krakov region. As for me, I wanted to become a warrior, but he gave me to a clerical academy instead.
str_npc4_home_recap|A Cossack homestead near the Yellow Waters. It was here that I first took my blade in my hands -- here that I smoked my first pipe.
str_npc5_home_recap|My family are descendants from the crusaders who fought the pagans of Karelia, and who finally settled in the lands.
str_npc6_home_recap|Oh, my lot is a bitter one. As I pass through my home town, I must hide in the shadows. I cannot even visit the graves of my parents!
str_npc7_home_recap|Our estate is not far from Old Ryazan. It was there that I was born.
str_npc8_home_recap|As I look on this shore where we used to play hide-go-seek as children, my eyes fill with tears.
str_npc9_home_recap|My parents owned a house in the Old Town. That is where my mother was delivered of her burden.
str_npc10_home_recap|The days of my youth were spent in a palace so grand that these halls of power would just seem a dirty hut by comparison...
str_npc11_home_recap|Where was I born? In the steppe. A nomad cannot name his birthplace more precisely than this.
str_npc12_home_recap|A small house on the slopes of Schekavitsa, which offered a view on the Dniepr and the Glybochitsk harbor. These are my first childhood remembrances.
str_npc13_home_recap|I had better not recall. When I think of my poor house by Poltava, my eyes fill with tears.
str_npc14_home_recap|Reval, Reval... oh, I wish I could glimpse just for a moment that narrow street, that old house of ours.
str_npc15_home_recap|Novgorod is my homeland. There is no finer town in all of Rus.
str_npc16_home_recap|I was born in the ancient town of Kafa.

str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|Word has it that you have pledged your allegiance to my enemy. But I feel nothing evil would come of a little talk.
str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you enlist with a warlord worthy of your valor.
str_comment_intro_famous_martial|I have heard of your exploits. God willing, we shall meet in battle some day...
str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I have heard of you. Well, I am not one to waste time with polite conversation. If you have something to say, out with it.
str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. Perhaps we should speak together some time.
str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|At last we meet. Word has it that you are a true warrior. Perhaps we should get together and talk, from time to time.
str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name. So oft it's heard together with the word "wanted"... But that is no concern of mine.
str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! We meet at last.
str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honor and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I need able warriors, but you must prove yourself first.
str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I've heard your name somewhere, but I cannot recall where exactly. Never mind, 'tis no matter. If we meet in battle, we'll surely find out more about each other.
str_comment_intro_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on your banner. No doubt you are another foreigner come to our lands, as if we didn't have enough here already.
str_comment_intro_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Another vulture come to grow fat on the carrion of war, no doubt!
str_comment_intro_noble_cunning|You look like a noble, but there are many impostors nowadays who look like nobles. Still, it is always worthwhile to make the acquaintance of one who may one day become a great warlord.
str_comment_intro_noble_sadistic|Strange thing, I don't know your name. You must be one of these "new" nobles? Or perhaps you just claimed a fictional title?
str_comment_intro_noble_goodnatured|Do not be put off, but I do not recognize your banner. Forgive my ignorance, {sir/madame}! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_noble_upstanding|I don't know your name. I can only trust your word that you're of noble birth.
str_comment_intro_common_liege|You may be of common birth, but know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, if they can prove themselves worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_common_martial|Perhaps you are not of gentle birth, but if you prove your courage and honor, then I would consider you an equal -- on the battlefield.
str_comment_intro_common_badtempered|Speak quickly, if you have anything to say, for I have no time for twaddle.
str_comment_intro_common_pitiless|A mercenary? Another headache. Soon there'll be no place to hide from these soldiers of fortune...
str_comment_intro_common_cunning|Well... I have not heard of you, but you have the look of a {man/woman} who might make something of {himself/herself}, some day.
str_comment_intro_common_sadistic|A serf usually can count on a good beating from me if he asks me anything. But today I'm in a good mood, so speak.
str_comment_intro_common_goodnatured|Glad to see you.
str_comment_intro_common_upstanding|Greetings, {sir/madam}, and always remember that a noble warrior should be just and upright.
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_enemy_benevolent|You have attacked innocent peasants under my protection in the village of {s51}... Now your life isn't worth even a thaler!
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_enemy_spiteful|You have raided my village of {s51}, destroying my property and killing the tenants. I will take my compensation in blood!
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_enemy_coldblooded|You have raided my village of {s51}, destroying property and killing the tenants. If you wish to live, stay away from my lands.
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_enemy|You have raided my village of {s51}, destroying my property and killing tenants under my protection. You will pay dearly for your crimes!
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_unfriendly_spiteful|You have raided the village of {s51}. That village is mine, and you shall have to answer for your misdeeds...
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_friendly|You have raided the village of {s51}. That village is mine. We have nothing to talk about now.
str_comment_you_raided_my_village_default|You have raided the village of {s51}. That village is mine. If you continue to behave this way, we may soon come to blows.
str_comment_you_robbed_my_village_enemy_coldblooded|You have robbed my tenants in the village of {s51}. I take that as a personal insult.
str_comment_you_robbed_my_village_enemy|You have robbed innocent peasants under my protection in the village of {s51}. Prepare to answer for your misdeeds!
str_comment_you_robbed_my_village_friendly_spiteful|I have heard that you pinched some food from my tenants at {s51}. It is a time of war, I know all to well, but nothing is free in this life.
str_comment_you_robbed_my_village_friendly|I have heard that you requisitioned supplies from my tenants at {s51}. War is war, eh? Well them I'm sure you won't hold a grudge if something happens...
str_comment_you_robbed_my_village_default|You have robbed my tenants in the village of {s51}. A good idea for a bandit, but a bad one for a man who treasures my friendship...
str_comment_you_accosted_my_caravan_enemy|You have been accosting carts that I am ordered to protect! Brigands do not survive long in these lands.
str_comment_you_accosted_my_caravan_default|You have been accosting carts under my protection. I hope you did this in error. Otherwise, I shall have to teach you a lesson.
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_benevolent|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. I had been neglectful in my duties as their lord and protector, and am I grateful for what you have done.
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_friendly_cruel|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. That was very gracious, but I prefer to settle business with my people myself.
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_friendly|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. You like playing a savior? Well, I shan't interfere...
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_unfriendly_spiteful|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. As amusing as it is to see you grubbing for favor among my subjects, I would ask that you mind your own business.
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_cruel|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. As the peasants' lord and protector, it is most properly my duty to assist them in times of hardship. You may mean well, but your actions still undercut my authority. I would thank you to leave them alone.
str_comment_you_helped_villagers_default|I heard that you gave charity to my tenants in the village of {s51}. Times are hard, and I know that you mean well, but try not to make a habit of it. I am their lord and protector, and I would rather not have them go looking to strangers for assistance.
str_comment_you_captured_a_castle_allied_friendly|I heard that you have besieged and taken {s51}. That was a great deed, and I am proud to call you my friend!
str_comment_you_captured_a_castle_allied_spiteful|I heard that you have besieged and taken {s51}. Good work! Rich trophies and barrels of good wine always await behind enemy castle walls!
str_comment_you_captured_a_castle_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|I heard that you have besieged and taken {s51}. I don't think you'll hold it though. No one likes people who over-step their position.
str_comment_you_captured_a_castle_allied_unfriendly|I heard that you have besieged and taken {s51}. Whatever our differences in the past, I must offer you my congratulations.
str_comment_you_captured_a_castle_allied|I heard that you have besieged and taken {s51}. Verily, these townsmen had it coming, I believe.
str_comment_you_captured_my_castle_enemy_spiteful|I hear that you have broken into my home at {s51}. You belong in the dungeon!
str_comment_you_captured_my_castle_enemy_chivalrous|You are holding {s51}, my rightful fief. When I win it back, you shall be the main attraction at the city gates, with a rope around your neck!
str_comment_you_captured_my_castle_enemy|{s51} is mine, do not presume you can hold it for long!
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_unfriendly_spiteful|Remember {s54}? So do I. Then you understand what the fates have in store for you.
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_unfriendly|I will not forget how we fought together against {s54}. Of course you would deserve a commendation, were it not for your past deeds...
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_cruel|Who could have thought that {s54} would be defeated so utterly?
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_quarrelsome|I shan't forget how we whipped {s54}? I enjoyed that.
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_upstanding|I will not forget our victory over {s54}. Let us once again raise our cups to commemorate it!
str_comment_we_defeated_a_lord_default|That was a great victory over {s54}, wasn't it? I am honored to have fought by your side.
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_unfriendly_spiteful|I suppose you will want to drink to the memory of our capture of {s51}. Perhaps the wine will help me forget your earlier disgraces.
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_unfriendly|I will not forget how together we stormed {s51}, but I can also not forget all the evil you've caused me.
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_cruel|I won't ever forget how we stormed the fortress and cut down the defenders like grouse! The best hunt in my life!
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_quarrelsome|Remember how the enemy squealed when we came over the walls of {s51}? They had thought they were safe! We wiped the smug smiles off their faces!
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_upstanding|I shall always remember the assault on {s51}. Songs are sung about such battles!
str_comment_we_fought_in_siege_default|I will not forget how together we captured {s51}. I am honored to have fought by your side.

str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_cruel|I won't forget the great battle near {s51}, when we broke through the enemy lines and they ran screaming before us. It is a sweet memory.
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_quarrelsome|That was a fine fight near {s51}, when we made those bastards run!
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_upstanding|I will not forget how we fought side by side at the battle near {s51}. Let us once again give thanks to heaven, and pray that we not grow too proud.
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_default|I will not forget how we fought side by side at the great battle near {s51}. I am honored to have shared the battlefield with you.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_liege|So, you crossed swords with that rascal they call {s54}, and emerged victorious. I am very happy to hear it.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|I heard that you fought and defeated {s54}. Every dog has its day, I suppose.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_spiteful|I heard that you fought and defeated that dog {s54}. Ah, if only I could have seen his disgrace.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_chivalrous|I heard that you fought and defeated {s54}. I hope this is true.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied|I heard that you fought and defeated {s54}. I wish you joy of your victory.
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy_chivalrous|Well, last time you prevailed. Let us see what comes next.
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy_spiteful|I have been looking forward to meeting you again. Your tricks will not deceive me a second time, and I will relish hearing your cries for mercy.
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy|When last we met, {playername}, you had the better of me. But I assure you that it will not happen again!
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_spiteful|Back for more? Make me fight you again, and I'll feed your bowels to my hounds.
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_chivalrous|Come to test your valor against me again, {playername}?
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_benevolent|So once again you come at me? Will you never learn?
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_coldblooded|You are persistent, and are becoming a real nuisance.
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy|How many times must I beat you before you learn to keep your distance?
str_comment_we_were_defeated_unfriendly_spiteful|Last I saw you, you had been struck down by the men of {s54}. I blame you for that disaster. What a pity to see that you've survived.
str_comment_we_were_defeated_unfriendly|Last I saw you, you had been struck down by the men of {s54}. Well, I see that you survived.
str_comment_we_were_defeated_cruel|Last I saw you, you had been struck down by the men of {s54}. Don't worry -- we'll find him, and make him regret his deeds.
str_comment_we_were_defeated_default|Last I saw you, you had been struck down by the men of {s54}. It is good to see you alive and well.
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_friendly_spiteful|I heard that {s54} gave you a hard time. I think he shall have to pay for it.
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_unfriendly_cruel|I had heard that {s54} slaughtered your men like sheep. But here you are, alive. Such a disappointment!

str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_pitiless|I heard that {s54} defeated you, and scattered your troops. That is most disappointing...
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_unfriendly_upstanding|I heard that {s54} defeated you. Perhaps you should consider your misdeeds... What might cause heaven to rebuke you in this way?

str_troop_train_request_cunning|But men, like swords, are tempered and hardened by fire.
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|They need someone with steel in his back to flog some courage into them, or kill them trying.
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads, but I am afraid that they are not quite ready for battle just yet.

str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? Well. You disappoint me. And that is a most unwise thing to do.
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but none can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me do not always live to regret it.

str_lord_follow_refusal_sadistic|I think not! Rather, you should follow me, as a whipped cur follows {his/her} master.

str_rebellion_dilemma_default|[subject]
str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his throne illegally.
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't see that I owe him much. However, {s45} might be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. This is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weigh my decision carefully...
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of homage to {s46}, though the powerful are not bound by their oaths as are ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order, and prevent war.
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what is in it for me?
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I cannot imagine that I am still bound.
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This spells troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my homage to {s46} null and void, and dissolve the bonds which prevent our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am also pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession, and {s45} also has a valid claim to the throne.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_default|[subject]
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in both war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|So tell me, why should I turn my back on a bastard I know, in favor of {reg3?a woman:a bastard} I don't?
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position to be in, to be asked whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land. Yet it is also a time of opportunity, for me to reap the rewards that have always been my due!
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged, and thus he will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim has never been questioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but if on the other hand I bring {s46} your head, I might receive an even greater reward.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me with decency, but it is true that he has done wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my homage to {s46}, but I also think it is wrong to support injustice.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm. I should not wish it laid to waste by civil war and ravaged by its enemies.

str_rebellion_rival_martial|Your ally {s44} once questioned my honor and my bravery. I look forward to the chance of facing him in battle, that I might make him eat his words.
str_rebellion_rival_quarrelsome|You're working with {s44}. He's a crafty weasel, and I don't trust him one bit.
str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|You seem to have enlisted the support of {s44}... He is soft and weak, and not fit to govern a fief, and one whom I have always detested.
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong and quarrelsome, and something of a of liability.
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|I have no desire to fight alongside your ally {s44}, who puts on such a nauseating display of virtue.
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|I would be reluctant to throw my lot in with the likes of {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.
str_rebellion_rival_upstanding|Your ally {s44} is in my opinion a dangerous, unreliable, and highly unprincipled man.
str_rebellion_argument_favorable|I respect your line of argument
str_rebellion_argument_neutral|I find your line of argument somewhat compelling
str_rebellion_argument_unfavorable|I do not find your line of argument compelling
str_rebellion_persuasion_favorable|you talk sense
str_rebellion_persuasion_neutral|your reasons are clear
str_rebellion_persuasion_unfavorable|you make an unconvincing case
str_rebellion_relation_very_favorable|I have the greatest respect for you personally.
str_rebellion_relation_favorable|I know and respect you personally.
str_rebellion_relation_neutral|I do not know you as well as I might like.
str_rebellion_relation_unfavorable|I do not trust you.
str_and_comma_3|Furthermore, 
str_but_comma_3|However,
str_and_comma_1|, and

str_and_comma_2|. Moreover, 
str_but_comma_2|. I think, 
str_rebellion_agree_default|[subject]
str_rebellion_agree_martial|Very well, I have decided. I shall back {s45} as the rightful heir.
str_rebellion_agree_quarrelsome|Ahh, it seems you talk sense. I never did like {s46} much anyway. A more worthy man should sit on the throne.
str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate. I have decided to join you. Pray do not give me cause to regret this decision.
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous plan... but after careful consideration, I have decided that I will join you. Let us pray that we are not making a terrible mistake.
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|Oh well... I will back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. But you'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well!
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|All right. I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good ruler. I shall join you.
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first duty is to this realm, and to save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May Heaven forgive me if I am wrong.
str_rebellion_refuse_default|[subject]
str_rebellion_refuse_martial|I fear I must disappoint you. {s45} has a good claim, but it is not enough for me to turn my back on {s46}. I will remain loyal to my lord.
str_rebellion_refuse_quarrelsome|I say nay. Your whelp {s45} doesn't have what it takes to rule this realm. I'm sticking with {s46}.
str_rebellion_refuse_pitiless|Nay, I will not support your rebellion. Your rage is that of a spoilt child who cries for a new toy. {s46} rules by right, and a just ruler he is!
str_rebellion_refuse_cunning|Forgive me, but I do not believe you stand much of a chance. Many shall die, and I have no desire to be one of them. I'm afraid we must go our separate ways.
str_rebellion_refuse_sadistic|No, these games are not for me. You strive for the crown, but in the end you'll only hang from the gallows, as {s46} and I look on.
str_rebellion_refuse_goodnatured|Forgive me, but {s46} does not deserve my betrayal. I hope you won't hold my refusal against me.
str_rebellion_refuse_upstanding|Forgive me, but I do not believe {s45} could rule fairly, and I shall not support an uprising. I fear I must go my own way, may Heaven forgive me if I'm wrong.
str_talk_later_default|[subject]
str_talk_later_martial|Now is no time to talk politics! I am here today with my fellow lords, armed for battle. You had better prepare to fight.
str_talk_later_quarrelsome|Do you expect me to discuss betraying my lord with you, while we are surrounded by his army? What do you take me for, a bloody idiot?
str_talk_later_pitiless|Still your tongue! Whatever I have to say on this matter, I will not say it here and now, while we are in the midst of our army.
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can discuss it at a later time and a different place, but for now we remain enemies.
str_talk_later_sadistic|You should have your mouth sewn shut! Can you imagine what would happen if the other nobles see me speaking to you of treason?
str_talk_later_goodnatured|So you wish to discuss your rebellion with me? Try again when we aren't surrounded by my lord's army, and I will hear what you have to say.
str_talk_later_upstanding|Whatever my thoughts on the legitimacy of the succession, I am not about to discuss them here and now. If we should meet again where we can talk in privacy, then I shall hear what you have to say on the matter. But for now, consider me your enemy.
str_gossip_about_character_default|They say that {s6} is rather a bore.
str_gossip_about_character_martial|They say that {s6} loves nothing more than war.
str_gossip_about_character_quarrelsome|They say that {s6} almost came to blows with another noble lately, because the man made a joke about his nose.
str_gossip_about_character_selfrighteous|I heard that {s6} had a squire executed because the unfortunate man killed a deer in his forest.
str_gossip_about_character_cunning|They say that {s6} is a cunning opponent.
str_gossip_about_character_sadistic|They say that {s6} likes to torture his enemies. I wouldn't want to get on the bad side of that man.
str_gossip_about_character_goodnatured|They say that {s6} is a good man and treats people living in his lands decently. That is more than can be said for most of the nobles.
str_gossip_about_character_upstanding|People say that it is good to be in the service of {s6}. He is good to his followers, and rewards them if they work well.
str_latest_rumor|The latest rumor you heard about {s6} was:
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Prince Janusz Radziwill.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am the chief of the Don Cossacks. Stepan Razin they call me.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Mehmed, of the Crimean Girays.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_intro|My name is Christina, the Sixth Queen of Sweden, the mistress of all Goths and Wends.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_intro|My name is Ivan Barabash. Aye, the Hetman whom all believe long dead.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1|We Radziwill are descendants of the Grand Prince of Lithuania, Gediminas, just as the Jagiellon that ruled the Polish Commonwealth. Compared to us, the kings of today are just newcomers with no right either to the crown of Poland, or to that of Lithuania.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I have been on many raids against the Tatars at the behest of the Moscow Tsar. And how does he show his gratitude? My brother was executed on a calumny, I am now hunted and ordered to be jailed.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am the elder son of Khan Selyamet. Until recently, the Khan's palace in Bakhchisaray was my rightful dwelling, but the Sultan of the Porte to whom all Giray swear allegiance considered me unfit for my duties, and put my younger brother, Islam, in my place!
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am the only daughter of King Gustaf II Adolf and Maria Eleanor of Brandenburg. All the estates of Sweden swore to me an oath of allegiance when I reached one year of age. As future queen, I received a splendid education. I mastered seven languages -- German, Dutch, Danish, Italian, Spanish, Greek and Latin; I have read Aesop, Justinus, Livius, Caesar, and Vergilius. When I reached twelve, I was already quite adept at politics and the art of war.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1|A Cossack by blood, I am. I was the yesaul of the regiment, then a Colonel, then acting Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host. In all ages I tried to live in peace with the Polish gentry... Yet the field secretary, Bogdan Hmelnitski, stirred up the Zaporozhians of the Sich and began a rebellion. The serving Cossacks under my leadership helped the crown forces to quell the rebels, but before the Battle of Yellow Waters, Hmelnitski managed to draw all the chiefs to his side.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|The Polish king is elected by senators. This is the root of all our misfortunes. The Polish Commonwealth shall never become a great nation until a true king reigns from the throne, one who would bear the title by right of blood and not by whim of the gentry.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2|The Tsar of Russia dreams of strangling all the liberties of the Don, yet the Cossacks shall stand up for themselves. Once a true heir to the throne arrives, we shall start a rebellion. And then just wait, Alexei Mikhailovich!
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2|My being deposed was a terrible injustice! Islam Giray knows nothing of stately affairs, and rather than supporting the Polish Commonwealth, he aims for a union with the Cossacks. Only together with the Polish king can we hold back the dragon of Moscow in its onslaught south...
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Rising to the throne, I chose to remain a virgin, much like Elizabeth of England, and I chose my brother-in-law, Carl Gustaf of Pfalz, as my heir. Yet the treacherous Carl was not content with the natural flow of time, and desired to hurry his way to power.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2|The night before the battle, they entered the hetman's tent, but I was warned beforehand, and escaped with my life. They thought I was dead, once they saw a body cut to pieces. But it was only the body of my servant. You know what I say? Hmelnitski does not have the future of our people in mind, he is moved by vainglory and revenge. He spells the end Ukraine -- of this I have no doubt.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I need daring people to rise up against the invader and restore Great Lithuania. And I have full right, as the elder of Zmudz, the warlord of Vilna, and the Great Hetman of Lithuania!
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3|In all sincerity, I would have long cried out the rallying cry, "Saryn on kichka!" But where can I find the one who would claim the Tsar's throne?
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I seek trusted allies. If the Crimean Mirzas would take my side, then the Sultan would have no choice but to appoint me Khan once more.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3|After securing the support of the army, he forced me to abdicate. And this after I won the Thirty-Year War and bestowed heretofore unimagined privileges on the nobles! I am sure, if only I issue a call, that Sweden will rally under my hand once more!
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Once I become hetman once more, I can settle matters with the Polish Commonwealth, and Ukraine shall prosper anew among brotherly nations!
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|If you are in secret talks with Radziwill, I fear I have to disappoint you. These Zmudz Protestants have too high an opinion of their kin, though they are nothing more than arrogant Lithuanian magnates whose purses are as over-stuffed as their ambition.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Word has it that one of the Cossack chiefs, what's his name... Stenka Razin, eh -- that he has started a rebellion against the Don. I can hardly wait to see him in the Kremlin. In chains, of course.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1|I see you have spoken to the loser Mehmed? Yea, a Khan he was, yet after the coward gave up our lands on the Caucasus to the Tsar of Moscow, and took the Cossacks' side, the glorious Sultan, may his rule last for ages, restored justice and handed me the reins of government.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Christina is longing for the throne? She was always a loose cannon. First she almost led the nation into ruin -- doubled the ranks of nobles, gave away the lands of the crown, while she squandered the treasury for court entertainment and pretty-petties for her favorites. Then suddenly she turned to Catholicism.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Ivan Barabash has long since sold out to the damned Poles. Became the field marshal and levied unbearable taxes on the Cossacks to curry favor with the Polish king -- and then helped spread the Catholic faith. That traitor shall lead Ukraine right back into Polish serfdom.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2|A horseless gentryman of Poland would become king sooner than any of these Vilna schismatics.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2|We Romanovs are the rightful holders of the Cap of Monomakh, and these mutineers who resolved to rebel against us will be placed on racks and broken on the wheel. If you have involved yourself in their affairs by foolishness or lack of wit, then go to the Secret Department and confess all you know -- or pay the price.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2|I doubt his return would gladden the Mirzas. Thus my advice would be to forget of his existence. The only man longing to meet him is my new executioner.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Whatever she might say today, she abdicated of her own free will. Her abdication was officially accepted at the Rijksdag, and taxes are set on Gottland, Aland, Asel, Pomerania and other regions. Sweden is a nation of Protestant soldiers, and it has no need for a Catholic queen who pretends she is Elizabeth of England.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The Pereyaslav Council ordered all Cossacks to swear homage to the Tsar of Moscow. Only under the wing of an Orthodox nation would our people be truly free. And believe me, the future of our land lies not in a union with Catholic Poland. Only a hetman who lost his mind would make war against Russia...

str_quick_battle_troop_1|The Reiters (from the German word Ritter, meaning knight) are a complement of heavily armored soldiers with firearms. They can weaken the enemy by shooting, and then destroy them in melee combat. However, the Reiters are inferior in skill to both professional shooters and 'true' heavy cavalry.^Reiter regiments comprise up to 2000 cavalrymen, with one squadron equipped with lances and the rest with pistols. Like waves, ranks of Reiters gallop towards the enemy and overwhelm them by pistol fire. 
str_quick_battle_troop_2|These unique Polish horsemen are likely the finest heavy cavalry to have ever trodden the earth. Drawn from the brave Polish gentry, the swift hussars boast the finest equipment and military training of the time. The mere sight of these heavily armored warriors charging on their mighty horses would often be enough to inspire panic in the enemy ranks, and break the line of any troops still holding their ground. Nevertheless the hussars should avoid large groups of shooters, especially on a difficult terrain. The hussars' greatest moment of glory came in the battle at Vienna, where they held back the Turkish invasion of Europe. ^In the 17th century, the hussars were considered the best cavalry in the world. 
str_quick_battle_troop_3|In these perfectly trained and equipped Boyars, all the might of western cavalry is combined with the speed of the east. Certain Europeans may call the Boyars a relic of feudalism, but none would say this to their face! ^The Boyars were the hereditary feudal elite of Russia from the 10th all the way through the 17th century. The Boyar class was highest among service class people, entitled not only to sit in the Boyar dumb, but to hold the highest status in it. However, the abolition of Mestnichestvo (the feudal hierarchical system of the time) in 1682 seriously undermined the power of the Boyars, and the Boyar title was eliminated by Peter the Great at the beginning of the 17th century. 
str_quick_battle_troop_4|The cuirassiers (from the French word cuirass, armor) are a cavalry corps equipped with light chest armor, the cuirass. They developed in the 16th century in many European countries, and were designed to compensate for the dearth of knights in heavy cavalry. The cuirassiers' suite of armor (called 'cuirass armor') was reduced to a half-armor piece which was relatively inexpensive. By the 16th century, it consisted only of a helmet and a cuirass proper. Initially, when cuirassiers fought alongside knights, they wielded the same type of sword, but later they switched to using broadswords, and in certain armies, heavy sabers.
str_quick_battle_troop_5|The bulk of the Tatar host were the jasaqs. Though average warriors, they posed a serious threat to the enemy because of their sheer numbers and their maneuverability. The jasaqs fight with a good bow and a saber of mediocre quality. The jasaqs are formidable archers, and are most effective in sidelong attacks. 
str_quick_battle_troop_6|Musketeers form the core of any army. Their shooting skills make their presence on the battlefield decisive, as the tide of battle may be turned by a single musket salvo. However, in melee musketeers are extremely weak against cavalry or heavy infantry, and therefore must be protected by cavalry units or pikemen.^By the middle of the 16th century, most wars were fought with muskets, a weapon far more effective than its long-range predecessors, specifically the bow and the crossbow. An average person could learn to use the musket fairly quickly. The majority of low-rank musketeers were drawn from townsmen and peasants.
str_quick_battle_troop_7|The netyagi proved themselves to be an admirable force. Their bravery and fighting spirit compensated for their lack of armor. While a pistol salvo at close range often guarantees their success, the netyagi can be easily trampled by cavalry. Naval campaigns, which were in essence pirate raids, were not unusual for Cossacks, and such sea voyages called for a new type of troops. Landing on an enemy shore was not always a bloodless affair, and merchant vessels were hardly defenseless either. The netyagi were first used on such sea raids. They would suffer heavy casualties as they leapt from the deck onto dry land or enemy ships, with no heavy armor to protect them or time to regroup and launch an attack. Netyagi were likewise employed in strictly land-based warfare, where they served as shock troops, the first to make contact with the enemy and to withstand the initial onslaught.
str_quick_battle_troop_8|These fully armored and well-trained warriors fight with two-handed swords. Heavy infantry forces are by design placed in the front ranks, with the objective of breaking the enemy line. It is crucial to protect these warriors from enemy volleys, while in melee they can take care of themselves!
str_quick_battle_troop_9|From the second half of the 16th century to the beginning of the 17th, the obsolete free lances were replaced by a new type of troop -- the Rondartschiere. They wore a cuirass and carried a sword and a small round shield. A highly disciplined corps, the Rondartschiere were effective in melee, against both infantry and light cavalry. On the other hand, the Rondartschiere would scarcely be able to stand against musketeers or heavy cavalry. Gradually, this type of infantry declined, due to the rapid development of firearms and the overall shift from close- to long-range combat. Pikemen, however, remained active, and in certain countries were employed into the beginning of the 19th century.
str_quick_battle_troop_10|Pikemen were a key part of European armies for a very long time. While firearms developed, armor was developing as well, and becoming lighter. Eventually, pikemen went into battle wearing only a cuirass to protect them from edged weapons, and a helmet to cover their heads. Pikemen wielded long pikes, hence the name. They fought in a close formation, and were designed to safeguard the musketeers from the attacks of enemy cavalry. ^Firearms were still far from perfect. As a rule, after one salvo, musketeers would either meet the enemy in hand-to-hand combat or exchange position with a back rank which had not yet taken a shot. In such circumstances, some infantry corps had to be equipped with armor and cold steel for close-range combat. Some armies employed pikemen into the beginning of the 19th century. 
str_quick_battle_troop_11|Fierce Scottish warriors were notorious all across Europe. Since the times of Edward III and William Wallace's revolt, Scottish pikemen had been famous for breaking English cavalry. Scottish halberdiers kept alive the glorious traditions of German free lancers and Swedish pikemen. This type of infantry dominated the field In the 15th and 16th centuries, and was still well in demand until the 17th century. Halberdiers successfully countered enemy cavalry and, due to the imperfections of ranged weapons, were able to withstand the onslaught of enemy infantry.

str_oim_polish_defeated|^In the year of our Lord 1655, the Polish king disbanded the Sejm -- that is, the Parliament -- and proclaimed himself Czar in the same fashion as the sovereign of Moscow. But the treasonous gentry could not let this stand, and soon revolt had gripped all the lands of Great Poland and Lithuania, Rusyn and Ukraine. In an attempt to stamp out the growing rebellion, the king hired German Landsknechts as mercenaries. ^^ Before long the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was consumed by the fires of war, like so much dry kindling. As for Jan Kasimir, the would-be czar, upon losing the loyalty of the people and the gentry, he abdicated the throne and fled, accompanied by his latest commander, a low-born warlord known as {playername}. At the border between Masovia and Prussia, they were ambushed by a large group of bandits, a common enough danger in those days. The king and his companions were killed, and no one has ever discovered where their remains lie hidden. ^^ Zenon Petretsky, "A Short History of the Polish Commonwealth" (1855).^^^

But the treasonous gentry could not let this act stand, and thus came the revolts in the lands of Great Poland, Lithuania, Rusyn and Ukrainian lands, which the king sought to pacify with German Landsknechts. Before long, the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth burned in the fires of war like so much dry kindling. Jan Kasimir himself fled, upon losing the loyalty of the people and the gentry, abdicating the throne. Along the border between Masovia and Prussia, he was ambushed by a large group of bandits, one of many such bands that plagued the land in those days.

str_zagloba_member_chat_1|You shall sooner count all the leaves on a tree than all the enemies I have slain. Were my hair as numerous as the foes I've brought down by my own hand, the barbers of Lukovo would make a fortune trimming my forelock! The devil take me if I lie...
str_zagloba_member_chat_2|In olden times, we had but one defeat for every ten victories, and the whole world was awed by our valor. Yet now we suffer nothing but defeat, and we are betrayed not only by lone rascals but by entire provinces! God have mercy on our homeland!
str_zagloba_member_chat_3|I have a mighty thirst to taste Swedish meat once more, like a wolf thirsting for lamb! Oh, aren't they scoundrels! Fleas must've gotten into their tiny stockings and bitten their legs, so they can't sit still at home and keep intruding on lands which are not theirs...
str_zagloba_member_chat_4|I have bled the Swedes quite a bit with these hands, and shall bleed them more yet. Few soldiers remain of those who had seen me under Putsk and Trcziana, but those who survive remember me well.
str_zagloba_member_chat_5|I am the old hero of Zbarazh... With this very hand I laid the axe on Burlai, the greatest hetman after Hmelnitski himself. Whosoever has not heard of Zagloba must have been under a rock during all the first Cossack War, or stuffed up his ears, or who knows what. I do hope that such a worthy man as you was not hiding under a rock, right?
str_zagloba_member_chat_6|It is time for my old bones to rest. I had best lay by the hearth, eat my curds with sour-cream, walk through the garden and pick apples, oversee the reapers' work and pat the girlies on the back. And perhaps even my foes will leave me be, for the Swede and the Cossack both know how heavy my hand can be. And God be willing, my name shall be celebrated by my brothers as well as it is feared by my enemies.
str_zagloba_member_chat_7|It is past time for me to rest, though the homeland is in peril and the foe tramples our lands. And here I am, bringing battle to the enemy, together with you, all in the name of our Motherland which nurtured us all. Whosoever shall not rise to defend her today, to deliver her from the scourge, is no son of the Motherland, but ungrateful stepchild unworthy of her love.
str_zagloba_member_chat_8|Even as I grow old, and God be willing, even as I lay dying, I shall cry out "Death to the Swedes, brothers! Forward!" Let us swear to grasp our blades steadfastly until we banish the enemy from our homeland!
str_zagloba_member_chat_9|Even the lion roars before a fight to fill himself with anger... As for great warriors, each has a manner of his own. Hannibal, they say, played the dice, Scipion of Africa read poems, Colonel Konetspolski, our father, loved to talk of girls, and as for me -- I must rest before battle, and drink a merry cup or two with my friends.
str_zagloba_member_chat_10|As old men say, the evil spirits dare not approach drinks, so you can drink everywhere and be safe. But beware food, and moreso of soup. There was a time, in Crimea, when I was in bondage. The Tatar mullahs -- that be priests in our tongue -- they could prepare lamb with garlic so good that you taste it once, and the very next second you're ready to forget your faith and follow their rascal prophet.
str_zagloba_member_chat_11|I made my way into the favor of the Crimean Khan himself, for discerning a plot to take his life while I was in my captivity. And our gracious King Jan Kasimir loves me dearly as well.
str_zagloba_member_chat_12|After every such sally, after we cut down five or ten thousand bandits, I can hear Hmelnitski banging his head on the wall, and saying: "That, I be damned, must be the work of that hellspawn Zagloba!" Well, after peace came to the Zborov, the Khan himself looked at me in awe, and asked me to leave a portrait, which he wanted to send as a souvenir to the Turkish Sultan.
str_zagloba_member_chat_13|I swear by God, this is an omen! We shall crush those villains, the Germans, the stocking-legged fish-eaters, and all the other lice-ridden and beardy scum who walk in sheepskin coats in winter and ride in sledges! We shall give them merry hell, and send them running for their lives. All whoever escapes we'll hunt down like dogs! Raise your hand and strike them down, all of you to whom the Motherland and your very honor are dear!
str_zagloba_member_chat_14|I know what rank means, and I can rise to any rank, you mark my words! A second Zbarazh shall I make here, a second Zbarazh! Radziwill will choke, and so will the Swedes, before any of them can swallow me! I even dare Khovansky to strike us! I would have buried him so well his remains would not be found until the Second Coming. Let them all come! Let them try!
str_zagloba_member_chat_15|All worthy men like to drink. Only traitors who nurse ill thoughts of their Motherland fear wine, lest they become drunk and betray themselves. Radziwill drinks birch-juice, but after his death he shall drink tar! Verily so shall it be, God help me!
str_zagloba_member_chat_16|My hands are full, but what can I do!? No one in our Commonwealth can use their wits, so old Zagloba must make double use of his one, while he still lives! And the worst part is that I still have no chancellery.
str_zagloba_member_chat_17|It is my belief that the misfortunes of our Motherland are all due to debauchery, unruliness and excesses -- yes I say excesses -- which devour us like the plague. Yet first of all, the heretics are to blame, for they ridicule the true faith, reviling our mistress who ought to strike them down with her righteous anger...
str_zagloba_member_chat_18|These times are such that whosoever holds the blade is right! And what right does the Swede and all our enemies then have, to ravage the lands of the Polish Commonwealth?
str_zagloba_member_chat_19|We had to send Khovansky a letter, demanding that he swiftly take himself to hell, lest we smoke him out of all our towns and strongholds. The Muscovites now lay still in Lithuania, and take no fortresses, but Zolotarenko's Cossacks plunder the people, roam about Lithuania in gangs of one or even two thousand blades. Let Khovansky pacify them, or we shall have to take the matter in our own hands.
str_zagloba_member_chat_20|I want to speak to our chosen one, our good lord, to comfort him in his misery -- to let him know that there still are people who have not left him, that there still are hearts and blades ready to battle at the mere wave of his hand. Let our father, our lord of noble Jagiellon blood, who is forced to live the life of a wanderer, have at least this small remedy.
str_zagloba_member_chat_21|Let us drink to the Huns' death, that they may eat our bread no more! Let them instead eat fir cones in Sweden!
str_zagloba_member_chat_22|Pity that old eyes see nothing in the dark. Alas, nothing can be done! Once it gets dark, I cannot wield a blade! In the day, in the light, this old man still loves to go to the battlefield. Give me Swedes -- and only the strong ones -- but only at noon!
str_zagloba_member_chat_23|I tell you, were one sin forgiven for every infidel this old hand sent to hell, I would have been sanctified by now -- and you would have to fast on my birthday, or perhaps I would even rise up into the heavens on a chariot of fire.
str_zagloba_member_chat_24|Oh you men, lowly men, how vain you are! Lord Jesus Christ, had you given me as many thousand thaler as there are claimants to the Polish crown, perhaps even I would have claimed it... What, do they think I am worse than they? Let them burst of their vain arrogance...
str_zagloba_member_chat_25|The chronicles would have said otherwise, but there is no luck in this world for me... Such is the gratitude of men... Oh well, it is not the first time... Others sit in warm, high places, becoming as cluttered with fat as badgers, but you old man, you shall ride your wretched nag until the end of time... Damn gratitude! We all go down, so let me at least serve my homeland for a little while before I lay myself down for good.
str_zagloba_member_chat_26|The German, the French, the British or the black-faced Spaniards, all of them grab the knife at first sight, but the Pole, patient by nature, shall endure many hardships, shall let the Swedes mock him for a long time, and then, when he cannot bear it any longer, he shall punch the Swede's face so hard that he will flip over backwards three times...
str_zagloba_member_chat_27|There remain bold youths in the Polish Commonwealth -- and while they still live and breathe, the Commonwealth shall never perish.
str_zagloba_member_chat_28|No trouble lasts forever. It all comes an end, or we shall be ruled by the devil and not our Lord Jesus, whose mercies are boundless.
str_zagloba_member_chat_29|The sooner we crush the Swedes, the better. Damn them! Let them give over Lettland, and pay a larger ransom and -- oh all right, all right, let him go back in one piece.
str_zagloba_member_chat_30|Oh Lord my God, have we committed a grave sin against our king? He who has been, is, and shall ever be our father, for he is heir to the house of Jagiellon! Such a king who was abandoned by those traitors who would lay in bed with the foreign devils. Ach, our lot is well earned...
str_zagloba_member_chat_31|Let Holy Mary Mother of God keep us, like that Colonel who was blasted along with his horse, and flew over the river Visla -- and found himself alive and well. Stood up and ran to a priest, all before lunchtime! Let us not panic! God willing, we shall pluck all foes like crayfish from their holes...
str_zagloba_member_chat_32|I was the king's most trusted confidant; choosing good elders is second nature to me, and I have given titles freely left and right. Many are indebted to my mercies, and when I entered into a place, all the senators there would bow down low, in good Cossack fashion.
str_zagloba_member_chat_33|More than once have I fought in contests before the king, and he always loved to watch my work. Even the Marshal would squirm and shut his eyes tight!
str_zagloba_member_chat_34|I am too old to storm strongholds... much better is an open fight in the field.
str_zagloba_member_chat_35|Many think of what awaits us. How many fights, how many defeats... How many tears? How much blood shall be shed? How many times shall our lives hang by a thread? And many fall to doubt, many sin in their hearts against God's mercy and the Holy Mother of God... Yet to you I speak -- do you know what awaits our enemies? Death. You know what awaits us? Victory!
str_getman_voron_book_full_text|A long time ago, in the lands of the polyan tribe, a piece of black iron fell from the sky, and was taken by their soothsayers. Where it fell they set up a pagan temple, worshipping the celestial gift as if it were bestowed upon them by the thunder-god Perun. Soon a large town, Kiev, rose up not far away. The soothsayers understood that this "sky iron" would protect their lands. Prince Svyatoslav Igorevich seized it from the soothsayers, and ordered a Black Mace forged from the iron. With this Black Mace, he won countless victories -- routed the Khazars and Bulgars, even threatened the all-powerful Romei of Byzantium. ^Nowadays there is a belief amongst the soldiers of the Prince, and the Cossack Starshinas, that he who holds the Black Mace shall have power for all the lands "as nigh as a three month journey from the city of Kiev". The soothsayers took their revenge on Prince Svyatoslav, as they once had on prince Oleg. They stole the mace while the prince was on one of his marches, and thereupon Svyatoslav died. The Black Mace fell into the hands of the princes of the house of Oleg. But thereafter its trail runs cold, and no one knows where it has landed.

str_ms_t_secret_order_long_descr_fac3|A mufti is often more important than the commander in the city, for he can judge any grievance according to Sharia law, and if the situation arises, he'll be the first to discover treason.
str_ms_t_secret_order_long_descr_fac4|A watchman keeps the public order. Rebels find it more difficult to weave their plots, and criminals have no rest.
str_ms_t_secret_order_long_descr_fac5|Cossacks are hot-tempered. They cannot go without arguments and disputes, wherever they settle. Without a watchman in the city, it is difficult to maintain order.

str_ms_v_secret_place_long_descr_fac1|You always need a place to keep the loot after a raid.
str_ms_v_secret_place_long_descr_fac2|Verily, the more you have, the easier you are to rob. But when you have a cache, you can better protect your goods.
str_ms_v_secret_place_long_descr_fac3|In these hard times, a hidden treasure house can be quite useful. Even barley is a treasure during times of war.
str_ms_v_secret_place_long_descr_fac4|In a hidden cache you can hide your supplies from the enemy.
str_ms_v_secret_place_long_descr_fac5|It is a poor lord indeed who has no hidden storehouse. After all, raiders can only take what they can find.
str_ms_v_secret_place_remour_descr_fac1|Folks say the elder is hiding a treasure somewhere -- a full twenty thaler!
str_ms_v_secret_place_remour_descr_fac2|The elder hid all the vodka somewhere, and the men haven't been to work for three days. They've spent all their time searching for the hiding place!
str_ms_v_secret_place_remour_descr_fac3|Our Bey is a greedy one. He built a storehouse but no one knows where.
str_ms_v_secret_place_remour_descr_fac4|The men say there's a huge stock of goods in a hidden cache somewhere. Now we no longer fear raids so much.
str_ms_v_secret_place_remour_descr_fac5|Yesterday the lads found a secret cache filled with vodka and lard. The elder almost burst from ire -- they ate and drank all the stocks!

str_ms_v_administration_short_descr_fac5|Council House
str_ms_v_administration_long_descr_fac1|A village council can be of great service to the elder. The people can gather in the evening to decide on all matters that are important to them.
str_ms_v_administration_long_descr_fac2|If there's a council house in the village, there will be more order.
str_ms_v_administration_long_descr_fac3|In the Bey's house you can keep criminals and pass judgment on them. Thanks to this, the people's welfare improves.
str_ms_v_administration_long_descr_fac4|In a watchhouse you can keep public nuisances and criminals. This reduces local disorder.
str_ms_v_administration_long_descr_fac5|The village house is where the important papers are kept. And if some lads start making trouble, you can lock them up in the house as a safety measure.
str_ms_v_administration_remour_descr_fac1|The elder and the tax collector sat in council the other day until early morning. When the sun arose, the townspeople carried them both out by their ankles.
str_ms_v_administration_remour_descr_fac2|One of the townspeople got himself drunk and made quite a nuisance of himself all night long. He was forced to spend three days in captivity for his behavior.
str_ms_v_administration_remour_descr_fac3|The village caught a thief the other day. He was held captive in the Bey's house until the guards arrived.
str_ms_v_administration_remour_descr_fac4|My neighbor was arrested yesterday. What did he do? Nothing much -- he just stole a horse...
str_ms_v_administration_remour_descr_fac5|Since the village house was built, you can't find the lads wandering the streets in the evening. -- They all gather in the village house to talk politics.

str_ms_v_judge_long_descr_fac1|Swift judgment means peace and order. If there's a judge in the village, the lord can sleep well.
str_ms_v_judge_long_descr_fac2|Your own judge in the village is indispensable. There's no need to wash your dirty linen in public.
str_ms_v_judge_long_descr_fac3|With a kadi in the village, all disputes are settled fast and justly, and the treasury keeps growing with new earnings.
str_ms_v_judge_long_descr_fac4|The councilor will always hear a plaintiff and issue a legal verdict -- for a fee, of course.
str_ms_v_judge_long_descr_fac5|The village justice is a much needed man. He won't allow the warlord to... misappropriate money, shall we say.
str_ms_v_judge_remour_descr_fac1|Folks say the new judge will accept no bribes. How hard must it be for him to make judgments?
str_ms_v_judge_remour_descr_fac2|The new judge only takes bribes in liquid thaler. He'll be a drunkard in no time.
str_ms_v_judge_remour_descr_fac3|Kadi Astakh hears a new dispute every evening. All the folks gather to watch -- his elaborate judgments are wonders to behold.
str_ms_v_judge_remour_descr_fac4|Word has it that the new judge will not yield to corruption! How can the villagers live now?
str_ms_v_judge_remour_descr_fac5|Yesterday the judge decided that the neighboring monastery's floodfield should in fact belong to the warlord. The warlord bribed him with a mere piece of meat.

str_ms_v_treasurer_short_descr_fac4|Treasurer
str_ms_v_treasurer_short_descr_fac5|Treasurer
str_ms_v_treasurer_long_descr_fac1|Gathering tributes is quite important. And if there's a certain man in charge of it, the lord's purse will grow all the heavier.
str_ms_v_treasurer_long_descr_fac2|A wise man collecting tributes will always be of use. He shall take some for himself, of course, but in the end more will arrive in the treasury.
str_ms_v_treasurer_long_descr_fac3|When a baskak is in charge of collecting taxes, things go quickly and smoothly.
str_ms_v_treasurer_long_descr_fac4|A treasurer in the village is great asset for the lord. A skilled man will do his job well.
str_ms_v_treasurer_long_descr_fac5|Your own skilled paymaster is a true find blessing for a landlord.
str_ms_v_treasurer_remour_descr_fac1|The new bursar shortchanged innkeeper Yankel. The latter in his misery decided to turn to the Christian faith.
str_ms_v_treasurer_remour_descr_fac2|The villagers found out that the new treasurer used to be a clerk at the mint. Word has it that he was fired for drinking.
str_ms_v_treasurer_remour_descr_fac3|Our baskak must have learned math in Baghdad! He shortchanges you in an eyeblink.
str_ms_v_treasurer_remour_descr_fac4|The treasurer has began keeping a book of accounts. Whatever he's writing there, only God knows, but now folks have to pay more...
str_ms_v_treasurer_remour_descr_fac5|The village paymaster came here the other day. Said we have to pay back taxes for two hundred years or so. We have him a quart of vodka, and now we're in debt only for a hundred years.

str_ms_v_priest_short_descr_fac5|Priest
str_ms_v_priest_long_descr_fac1|The village priest is a useful man. He can perform a burial and find out what's on the villagers' minds, too.
str_ms_v_priest_long_descr_fac2|The holy father is an important man in the village. Villagers like it when they don't have to travel to a neighboring town to visit a church.
str_ms_v_priest_long_descr_fac3|If there's a mullah in the village, clearly Allah's grace shines down upon its inhabitants.
str_ms_v_priest_long_descr_fac4|The pastor will always hear a confession and deliver absolution. And sinless villagers are better workers.
str_ms_v_priest_long_descr_fac5|One judges the flock by its priest, right? If the priest is loyal to the landlord, neither shall the flock rebel.
str_ms_v_priest_remour_descr_fac1|Our priest gave communion to two women from our parish -- the whole night long.
str_ms_v_priest_remour_descr_fac2|The holy father expelled a witch from the village the other day. The people say that she took the holy host right out of his mouth.
str_ms_v_priest_remour_descr_fac3|The new mullah is very young, but he knows all the Quran surahs by heart!
str_ms_v_priest_remour_descr_fac4|The new pastor gives absolution twice as frequently than the old one, but charges twice as much!
str_ms_v_priest_remour_descr_fac5|Our priest has a new wife -- his fifth or sixth, I think.

str_ms_v_police_master_short_descr_fac5|Marshal
str_ms_v_police_master_long_descr_fac1|A marshal is quite an aid for the elder. He'll look after the order in the village and will report any robbery.
str_ms_v_police_master_long_descr_fac2|If the village has a marshal, you need not worry about the public order.
str_ms_v_police_master_long_descr_fac3|A muhtasib stands to protect order. And when there's order, there's prosperity.
str_ms_v_police_master_long_descr_fac4|The marshal is not just the eyes and ears of the lord, but his whip as well. In a village with a bailiff, lawbreakers do not have it easy.
str_ms_v_police_master_long_descr_fac5|The marshal has a wide range of rights. He can punish folks with cats or with birch. And for the particularly troublesome, he can order a bastinado.
str_ms_v_police_master_remour_descr_fac1|Our marshal is a great guy. He put an end to the bandits in the nearby forest.
str_ms_v_police_master_remour_descr_fac2|The marshal found a stolen pig -- in a neighbor's kennel.
str_ms_v_police_master_remour_descr_fac3|The new muhtasib caught a pickpocket the other day.
str_ms_v_police_master_remour_descr_fac4|The marshal found out and put and end to a gang of counterfeiters.
str_ms_v_police_master_remour_descr_fac5|The marshal caught a horse thief. That poor guy didn't live long enough to see a trial.
