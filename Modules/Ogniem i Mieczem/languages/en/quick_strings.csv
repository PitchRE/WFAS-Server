But the treasonous gentry could not let this stand, and soon revolt had gripped all the lands of Great Poland and Lithuania, Rusyn and Ukraine. In an attempt to stamp out the growing rebellion, the king hired German Landsknechts as mercenaries. ^Before long the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was consumed by the fires of war, like so much dry kindling. As for Jan Kasimir, the would-be Czar, upon losing the loyalty of the people and the gentry, he abdicated the throne and fled, accompanied by his latest commander, a low-born warlord known as {playername}. At the border between Masovia and Prussia, they were ambushed by a large group of bandits, a common enough danger in those days. The king and his companions were killed, and no one has ever discovered where their remains lie hidden. ^Zenon Petretsky, "A Short History of the Polish Commonwealth" (1855).

qstr_You_came_into_the_wo|You came into the world a {reg3?daughter:son} of declining noble family, which owned only the house in which they lived. However, despite your family's hardships, they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood for the rigors of aristocracy and life at court.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{r|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of travelling merchants, always moving from place to place in search of profit. Although your parents were wealthier than most, and educated you as well as they could, you found little opportunity to make friends on the road, living mostly for the moments when you could help your family by making a sale.
qstr_As_a_child_your_fami|When you were a child, your family scraped by on the meager wages your father earned as a guardsman to the local lord. It was not an easy existence, and you were too poor to receive much of an education. You learned mainly how to defend yourself on the streets, with or without a weapon in hand.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:son}|{reg3?daughter:son}
qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?d|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family who lived off the woods, doing whatever they needed to make ends meet. Hunting, woodcutting, making arrows, even a spot of poaching whenever things got tight. Winter was never a good time for your family, as the cold took animals and people alike, but you always lived to see the next spring, though some of your brothers and sisters were not so fortunate.
qstr_You_were_a_child_of_|You were a child of the steppe, born to a tribe of wandering nomads who lived in great camps throughout the arid grasslands. Like the other tribesmen, your family revered horses above almost everything else, and they taught you how to ride almost before you learned how to walk. 
qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughte|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had but little education. Instead you were out on the street, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood. Still, these long years made you streetwise and knowledgeable of the secrets of cities and shadowy backways.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land. There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household. But from their chess games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition. You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed with a local craftsman to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your new master, he promoted you to journeyman and employed you as a fully paid craftsman for as long as you wished to stay.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_g|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were apprenticed to a wealthy merchant, picking up the trade over years of working shops and driving carts. You soon became adept at the art of buying low, selling high, and leaving the customer thinking they'd gotten the better deal.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_gr|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you took to the streets, doing whatever you needed to survive. Begging, thieving and working for gangs to earn your bread, you lived from day to day in this violent world, always one step ahead of the law and those who wished you ill.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_gro|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you rode the great steppes on a horse of your own, learning the ways of the grass and the desert. Although you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder in this trackless country. Your body too started to harden with muscle as you grew into the life of a nomad {reg3?woman:man}.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:man}|{reg3?daughter:man}
qstr_Though_the_distincti|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practiced long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too. You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your subjects. But in addition to learning the chivalric ideals, you also received less uplifting knowledge -- from the old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.
qstr_{reg3?woman:man}|{reg3?woman:man}
qstr_Though_the_distinctio|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband. However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court. You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realization that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.
qstr_Though_the_distinction|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. You set out on your own with nothing except an instrument slung over your back and your own voice. It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play, but you managed to survive on your music. As the years went by, you became adept at playing for the drunken crowds in the pubs, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. You found yourself as a student in the university of one of the great cities, where you studied theology, philosophy, and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls. You may not have always joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_f|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could. It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into giving you a good price. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fe|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to command fine prices. With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fel|You grew older and ultimately became a {reg3?woman:man}, and as you did, the whole world seemed to change around you. Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.
qstr_Only_you_know_exactl|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. Still, it was not a difficult choice to leave, with the rage burning brightly in your heart. You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone, and these debts can only be paid in blood...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. All you can say is that you couldn't bear to stay, not with the memories of those you loved so close and so painful. Perhaps your new life will let you forget, or honor the name that you can no longer bear to speak...

qstr_OIM_getman_heroe_can|A report by the preceptor of the Hungarian city of Berghoff to the grandmaster. ^^Greetings, Monsieur! I have learned that the legendary Black Mace is a relic of one of the greatest ruling families of Russia. According to the family legend of the house Oleg, in the mid-XII Century Anno Domini, their ancestors made a secret pact with the pagan priests, the soothsayers. The soothsayers held sway over the common folk, and it was through their influence that the Princes sought to usurp power. ^This is when the soothsayers gave to the Princes of the house of Oleg the Black Mace -- a mace of incredible power. Near Kiev, the Princes erected the Kirillovskiy Monastery where the mace is apparently kept. ^^A similar legend goes among the Zhmuda magnates, the Radziwill. As it turns out, the Radziwill have priestly ancestors going back well into the times of the house of Rurik.
