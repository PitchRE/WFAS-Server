dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|You look like a trader... but I don't see any merchandise.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|I beg your pardon -- there's no time for talk just now.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that. My merchandise is quite special, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|You sell livestock?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Near enough. It is thanks to me that the galleys of the Sublime Porte move, by my grace sail the taridas of the king of Sicily and even the ships of Louis the king of France.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Ah, galley slaves...
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Galley slaves, indeed! This city prospers thanks to my living goods. I am but its humble servant -- so to speak.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do your slaves come from?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|They come to me in a number of ways -- some are Yesir, Tatar captives or prisoners of war, or bandits and deserters captured during raids... You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners yourself, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me? 
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|And why not? You're a warrior clear enough, and in your battles you might take a prisoner or two. Anyhow, I pay good money for every man you can offer.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|See that you do! There's a lot of silver to be made, make no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I have something that might be of interest to you.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Well, then. Let's see what you have...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|Could you give a few tips on how to take somebody prisoner?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about taking prisoners?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|Ha, you're new to this, aren't you? Well it's not complicated. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is to knock him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, instead of cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while, instead of bleeding to death, you see? You do have a blunt weapon, don't you?
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|Umm, I don't think so.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. So, all you need to do is beat the sorry sod down with your weapon, and then when the fighting's over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, since they tend to be protected well enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use. But your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you go at him with anything sharp. I'm not too picky about what I'll buy, so long as they can walk.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must just be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. Here, have it, it's still strong enough to knock someone unconscious.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thank you. I'll give it a try.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and explain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is to knock him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, instead of cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while, instead of bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, since they tend to be protected well enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use. But your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you go at him with anything sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as it sounds. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so you'll have a little more trouble bringing your enemies down. And trust me, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, if you give them half a chance. So don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Plus, having to drag prisoners around will slow down your party, which is why some people just set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. Me, I call that madness. How could anyone turn down all that cash, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that it?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Ah yes, just one last thing. Managing prisoners is no easy task -- you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, it'll take no little sweat, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I need to get going...
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.
dlga_start:manhunter_talk_b|Hey, you there! You seen any outlaws around here?
dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b1|Yes, they passed through here about an hour ago.

dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b2|No, haven't seen any outlaws lately.

dlga_member_lady_1:member_lady_2b|Very soon. We're almost there.
dlga_member_lady_2a:close_window|Very well, I shall enjoy the road for a bit longer. I shan't complain. In fact, I find riding the open fields far more pleasant than sitting in the fortress all day. You know, I must say -- I envy you. Your life of endless travels...
dlga_member_lady_2b:close_window|That's good news. Not that I find your company unpleasant, but I grow weary of these long travels. Still, I must say, I will be sorry to leave you. You must promise that you'll come visit when you can!

dlga_pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_2:pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_3|No, I speak the truth. I fear that I cannot support you any longer.
dlga_pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_2:supported_pretender_pretalk|It was a mere jest. I will fight by your side until the last gun lies cold.
dlga_pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_3:pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_4|Are you quite certain? I shall never forgive you if you abandon our cause in our hour of greatest need.

dlga_event_triggered:companion_quitting|{s5}, there is something I must tell you.
dlga_companion_quitting:companion_quitting_2|{s5}
dlga_companion_quitting_2:companion_quitting_response|To tell you the truth, {s21}.
dlga_companion_quitting_response:companion_quitting_yes|Very well. Be off then.
dlga_companion_quitting_response:companion_quitting_persuasion|Perhaps I can persuade you to change your mind.
dlga_companion_quitting_persuasion:close_window|Hm. When you put it like that, I suppose I might stay a while longer, provided matters improve.
dlga_companion_quitting_persuasion:companion_quitting_response|I'm sorry, but I do not see your point. I shall take my leave of you now.
dlga_companion_quitting_response:companion_quitting_no|We hang deserters in this company.
dlga_companion_quitting_no:companion_quitting_no_confirm|Oh... I see. I see you do not mean that in jest...
dlga_companion_quitting_no_confirm:companion_quitting_no_confirmed|Absolutely. You may either leave this company by my order, or you are carried away on your shield.
dlga_companion_quitting_no_confirm:companion_quitting_yes|No, fear not -- I mean you no harm. You are free to leave.
dlga_companion_quitting_yes:close_window|Then this is farewell. Perhaps we shall meet again, {playername}.

dlga_pretender_intro_3:pretender_rebellion_cause_1|I thought {s12} was ruled by {s11}...
dlga_start:pretender_start.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_pretender_start:oim_getman_barabash_story|Tell me of the Black Mace.
dlga_pretender_start:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first|You were looking for me?
dlga_pretender_start:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5_pos_1|I changed my mind.
dlga_pretender_start:oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken|The Black Mace is mine, Colonel!
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_rebellion_cause_prelim|What was your story again, {reg65?my lady:sir}?
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_prelim:pretender_rebellion_cause_1|I shall tell you.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_1:pretender_rebellion_cause_2|{s48}
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_2:pretender_rebellion_cause_3|{s48}
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_3:pretender_start|{s48}
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_discuss_rebellion_1|I wish to take up your cause, and help you reclaim the throne!
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_end|I must leave now.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_1:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2|Your words are a great comfort, but are you certain that you are equal to the task, {playername}? Taking the throne is no simple matter. The nobles of our realm have all sworn oaths of fealty to {s11} -- a very powerful man. Oaths to such a usurper are invalid, of course, and we may expect some of the nobles to side with us, but it will be a very difficult and challenging struggle nevertheless.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_discuss_rebellion_3|I am ready for whatever may come.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_end|You are right. Perhaps I should think on this further...
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window|I have no doubt that your support for my cause is heartfelt, {playername}, and I am grateful to you for it. But I cannot think that we have much chance of success. However, if you prove yourself on the battlefield, and make a name for yourself as a great commander, then our friends will not hesitate to join our cause -- and our enemies will be wary to take up arms against us. When that time comes, I will join with you gladly. But until then, it would be wiser to quietly gather our strengths, and not openly challenge the usurper, {s11}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.1|Have you not already taken up the banner of {s17}? You would play two sides against the middle, it seems. Thank you kindly, but no -- I think I will not be a part of this game.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.2|{playername}, you are already oath-bound to serve {s15}. Thus, I cannot allow you to take up my cause, or my enemies would claim that I am but a mere puppet of {s16}. No, if I am to gain the throne of {s17}, I shall only do it through the righteousness of my cause, and the support of my loyal subjects. If you wish to lend me your arms, you must first free yourself of your oath to {s15}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:pretender_rebellion_ready|You are a capable warrior, {playername}, and I am sure that with your renown as a commander, and the righteousness of our cause, the nobles and the good people of {s12} will eagerly support us. Indeed, the time is ripe to act! I will join with you, and together, we shall topple the usurper {s11} and retake the throne from his bloody hands. But first, you must give me your oath of homage, and accept me as your {reg65?lady and master:liege lord}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_town_quest|Before we rebel, I ask that you raise support for my cause. I have always enjoyed strong backing from {s4}, but you may be able to find friends in other places. Are you willing to do this for me?
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_town_quest.1|Before we rebel, I ask that you raise support for my cause. If you have good ties with any of the towns, you should try there. Are you willing to do this for me?
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_start|The time is not yet right for a rebellion. Let us spend a while in quiet preparation.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_start.1|You have laid the groundwork for a rebellion, but you have sworn allegiance to another noble.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_rebellion_ready|You have done well. {s4}, and possibly other towns, are ready to join us. When you are ready, we shall ride forth to war.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_ready:lord_give_oath_2|I am ready to pledge myself to your cause, {reg3?my lady:my lord}.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_ready:pretender_end|Let us bide our time a little longer.
dlga_lord_give_conclude_2:close_window|Forward, then! Our first task is to take hold of a fortress, and persuade other nobles to join us. You shall lead the way!
dlga_pretender_town_quest:pretender_discuss_rebellion|The town is ready.
dlga_pretender_town_quest:pretender_end|I am not interested, thank you.
dlga_pretender_end:close_window|Farewell for now, then.
dlga_start:lord_event_choose_friend|I heard that you have befriended that {s43} also known as {s6}. Believe me, you can't trust that man. You would be wise to end your dealings with him.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_renounce|I assure you, {s65}, I am no friend of {s6}.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_renounce:lord_pretalk|That is well, {playername}. Otherwise, one might fear for your safety. If you do encounter {s6}, be on your guard -- and don't believe a word uttered by that snake's tongue.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_defend|{s6} is an honorable man. You've no right to speak of him thus.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_defend:lord_pretalk|As you will, {playername}. A fool you may be, but a loyal fool at the least. Be warned that {s6}'s loyalty may not be so constant...
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_neutral|I have no wish to involve myself in your quarrel with {s6}.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_neutral:lord_pretalk|Hmm... As you wish, {playername}. Just remember that a {man/woman} needs friends in this world, and you may find but few, if you will stand with no one.
dlga_start:lord_invite_1|{playername}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I keep hearing tales of such prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I know I have found someone worthy of becoming my vassal.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2|Thank you, {s65}. You honor me.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2.1|It is good to have my true value recognized.
dlga_lord_invite_2:lord_invite_3|Aye. Let us dispense with formalities, {playername}; are you prepared to swear your fealty to me?
dlga_lord_invite_3:lord_give_oath_2|Yes, {s65}.
dlga_lord_invite_3:lord_enter_service_reject|No, {s65}. I cannot serve you at present.
dlga_start:lord_start|If it isn't my brave champion, {playername}!
dlga_start:lord_start.1|It is good to see you again {playername}...
dlga_start:lord_start.2|And so we meet again, {playername}...
dlga_start:lord_meet_neutral|Do I know you?

dlga_start:lord_start.3|Well, {playername}...
dlga_lord_start:lord_start|{s42}
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed|Your surgeon managed to convince my friend to agree to the operation. The matter is in God's hands now -- all we can do is pray. No matter the outcome, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me, {sir/madam}. I shall never forget your generosity.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! That poor fool {s3} -- our little plot against him worked perfectly, {playername}. He has lost one of his most valuable nobles, and we are one step closer to bringing him to his knees. Here, this purse contains {reg5} thaler. I wish you to have it. And need I remind you -- there's much more to come for those with a mind to earn it...
dlga_lord_start:close_window|You proved yourself unable to complete even a simple task. I had arranged everything. All you needed to do was sacrifice a simple messenger, and we would be celebrating now. But no, I suppose your precious honor got in the way, eh?
dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news of that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, very good! Very good indeed. It is good to have competent {men/people} at my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Excellent work, {playername}! Your raids really got their attention, I must say. I've just received word that {s13} has declared war! Now the time has come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, {playername}. This war is sure to make us rich {men/souls}, mark my words!
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|You incompetent buffoon! What in Hell made you think that it would be wise to get yourself captured while we're trying to start a war?! These plans were months in preparation -- and now everything's been ruined! I shan't forget this, {playername}. Oh, rest assured that I will not.
dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I am told that you have collected the money owed me from {s7}. This is well -- it is past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it, eh? Well, that makes {reg3} thaler, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} thaler -- you can keep the rest.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} thaler, all here.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back. Please accept my sincere thanks.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me sir.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Do you jest? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every thaler owed me, {sir/madam}. As far as I'm concerned, you are personally in my debt until I see every last silver coin.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that damnable merchant that was causing me so much grief. -- And I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {man/woman}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight with some poxy, lowborn merchant? Verily, if ever I need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come straight to your door. You are dismissed, {playername}, I have matters to attend.
dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you should have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What on earth possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|Sir, I made certain that he will not act against you.
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were to remove him without a fuss, not give him a sermon and send him on his merry way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't utter a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/people} who cannot follow orders.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped. Even now, the pair are safely tucked away in my dungeon, awaiting questioning. My torturer shall have a busy night! I'm most pleased with your success, {playername}. Here, let me give you this purse as a token of my gratitude.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted two prisoners, {playername}. What you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows. It was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important member of the pair. The spy will never dare return, and will show himself quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you only half the promised reward for what is but a half success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of an oaf. Failing to capture neither the spy and his handler -- why, you plumb astonishing new depths of failure. Forget about the reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you wish, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Damn me, but you've done it, {playername}. All the serfs have returned, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You have certainly earned your reward. Here, take it with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}... I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, but not a one has returned. Have you an explanation for this? Outwitted by simple field hands were you? Or perhaps you merely incompetent -- or even plotting with my enemies, and intent on my ruin...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hah! 'Tis hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I must recruit some new men to work the fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you finally reveal your true colors, traitor! And your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were three groups of serfs that I charged you to return. Three. Not {reg17}. Ah well, I suppose those who did return shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let slip. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this has proven a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for this. Please, let me help pay for the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} thaler will be adequate.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Damn it, {playername}. I hear that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}. Indeed, thanks to you my village now lies in ruins. Everyone told me that you were an adept fighter, but apparently I was misinformed.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|{playername}, my quartermaster has informed me that you delivered the cattle! I don't know whether to count the heads or the tails, but either way, there's {reg13} of them. I'm impressed!
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|You are welcome, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.2|Heh... Mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me the reports of your work at {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, sir.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are running out, {playername}. I need you to bring {reg3} head of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care not where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, I will find you some cattle.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, sir, I have other plans.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! Now you know what to do, {playername}, so get to it. I need that cattle sooner than later.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That is... unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now. I've much work to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope your troops are experienced -- and in strong numbers.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|Yes, I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I still need more time.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. I shall send word when I have a task for you. For the moment, simply follow us and stay close. We'll be moving shortly.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you had better hurry. We will soon be moving against the enemy, and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We are sorely lacking information, and I simply must have a clearer picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14}, and {s15} -- and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|Agree...
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|Refuse...
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Pass near {s13}, {s14}, and {s15} and find out what's going on there. Make a note of anything you discover, and return here to me.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Most disappointed. We shall talk later. At present I must go and find a capable scout.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. You have my gratitude.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It is an honor to serve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I do believe you owe me {reg1} thaler, {playername}. Might I expect you to pay your debt any time soon?
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_1|That's why I came, {s65}. Here it is, all I owe you down to the last cooper.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_2|Alas, I am still a bit short on cash, {s65}. But I shall return what I owe soon enough.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, excellent. You are a {man/woman} of honor, {playername}. I am satisfied -- your debt to me has been paid in full.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_2:lord_pretalk|Very well -- but don't keep me waiting much longer.
dlga_lord_start:lord_buy_prisoner|I have received word you captured our enemy {s3} -- and indeed that he is with you this very moment. I can pay you {reg6} thaler for him, if you would care to be rid of him. You might also wait for his family to pay his ransom of course, but there's no telling how long that will take, eh?
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I shall leave {s3} to you for {reg6} thaler.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I'm afraid I can't accept your offer.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! Here's your {reg6} thaler. I shall send my men to take him to our prison with all due haste.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Mmm. As you wish, {playername}, but you shan't get a better offer. Take my word for it.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|So, what is your business?
dlga_lord_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_hero_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_lend_companion_end|I should like {s14} returned to me, {s65}, if you no longer require {reg3?her:his} services.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk|You have too many men in your company already, {playername}. You could not lead any more at the moment.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk.1|Certainly, {playername}. {reg3?She:He} is a bright {reg3?girl:fellow}. You're lucky to have such worthy companions.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_collect_debt|I've come to collect the debt you owe to {s1}.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt:lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2|Oh. Well {s1} did lend me some silver a ways back... but I've done him quite a few favors in the past -- and that money was due to me!
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:convince_begin|{s1} considers it a debt.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:lord_pretalk|Then I will not press the matter any further.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window|My debt to {s8} has long been overdue, and I was always troubled by it. Thank you for taking the money to him. Please give him this purse of {reg10} thaler, and thank him on my behalf.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_make_peace|It's high time to end this war between {s12} and {s13}, {s64}!
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace:lord_ask_to_make_peace_2|Eh? I'm not sure I heard you right, {playername}. War is never easily forgotten by either side, and I myself have a very long memory. Why should I take any interest in brokering a peace with those dogs?
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:convince_begin|Perhaps I might persuade you...
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind, no one seems interested in peace at present.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window.1|You... Yes, {playername}, I see the truth in what you say. Very well then, you have my blessing to bring an offer of peace to {s14}. I cannot guarantee they will accept it, but if they do, then I shall stand by it.
dlga_lord_talk:potop_deliver_swedish_troops|I want to talk about the Swedes...
dlga_lord_talk:potop_defend_monastery_done|I want to talk about the monastery...
dlga_lord_talk:potop_defend_monastery_done_failed|I want to talk about the monastery...
dlga_lord_talk:potop_deliver_swedish_troops_reward|I want to talk about the captive Swede...
dlga_lord_talk:oim_lendliz_talk_to_naum|Here be the goods that the Tsar of Moscow gave you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady|I hear word that you have slandered {s1}. You shall take back these foul words, or I'll still your lying tongue!
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2|What slander? Everyone knows that whenever her husband is away, she beds her stable boys and anyone else she can lay her hands on. I merely repeat the words of many.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_3|You had better stop this filthy gossip, sir, or you shall face my sword!
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_pretalk|Ahem... I'm not so sure...
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_3:close_window|You are challenging me to a duel? How amusing! Very well, as you wish, {playername} -- it will be good sport to bash your head in!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered|I bring a letter from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered:lord_pretalk|Oh? Let me see it... Well well well! My gratitude, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, and give my regards to {s9} when next you see him.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered_enemy|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered_enemy:close_window|Oh? Let me see that... Hmmm. My gratitude, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, with my thanks.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_deliver_message_prisoner|I bring a message from {s11}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2|Can it be true? Oh, thank you! Thank you, {playername}! You have brought hope and a small ray of light to these bleak walls. Perhaps one day I shall be able to repay you.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a| 'Twas the least I could do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a:close_window|You've no idea how grateful I am, {playername}. A thousand thanks and more.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b|Worry not, {s65}. You'll have ample opportunity to repay me once you are free again.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b:close_window|Ha ha, of course, {playername}. My eternal thanks go with you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer|Fear not, I am here to rescue you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2|By God, are you serious? What is your plan?
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3|A simple ruse, {s65}. If we exchange garments, I shall take your place here in prison, while you make your escape disguised as myself. Today the guards received a handsome bribe, with which I am sure they already purchased half the wine stocks of the nearest tavern. With some luck they'll soon be so drunk they'd have trouble recognizing their own mothers, let alone telling one of us from the other. And they won't be sober again for quite a while.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4|Hmm, it just might work... But what of you, my {friend/lady}? The guards won't take kindly to this trickery. What would they do to you when they find out?!
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a|Not to worry, {s65}. This place is already starting to grow on me.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b|I shall be fine so long as there is an ample reward awaiting me.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|You are a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|Of course, my {friend/lady}, of course! Come to me when you have regained your freedom, and perhaps I shall be able to repay the debt I owe you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6:close_window|Quickly, {s65}, let us change garments. It is past time you were away from here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced|{s66}, I wish to restore my old oath to {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_pretalk|That is too great a matter for me to decide, {playername}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_ask_pardon_terms|{s11}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk|As you like, {s65}. I shall accept your judgment.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.1|A shame, {s65}. A sad shame.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.2|Very well, go and die without me.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace|Aye, I am ready.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected|On second thought, no. I do not wish to enter once more into your service.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace.1|Aye, I agree to the terms.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected.1|The price is too high, {s65}. I must decline.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace:lord_pretalk|Excellent. Though you have strayed from us, {playername}, it gladdens our hearts that you have found your way back to the right path. I hereby restore your homage to me. Rise once more as an honored warrior in my service.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected:close_window|Then get out of my sight, you foul breed! Begone with you, and do not return!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon|I wish to make peace with {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk|Do you indeed, {playername}? Then fall upon your sword and give us all a bit of peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.1|{playername}, you are a {noble/noble} without a master, holding lands in your name, but with allegiance to no kingdom. So long as this continues, no regent would accept a lasting peace with you.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but your enemies shall not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you would need to bring no less than {reg16} thaler, if you would hope to find friends in {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} thaler.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay so much.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I shall use this coin to smooth the feathers of those who might oppose your pardon, and I'm sure word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About that task you assigned me...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_pay_mercenary|{Sir/Madam}, I humbly request the weekly payment for my service.
dlga_lord_pay_mercenary:lord_pay_mercenary_2|Hmm, let me see... According to my chancellery report, you are entitled to {reg8} thaler for your work. Here you are.
dlga_lord_pay_mercenary_2:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {sir/madam}.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my service!

dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Your duties... There are only a few, and none of them are difficult. The first thing is to declare your allegiance, an oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities. You'll participate in military campaigns, fulfill any tasks given to you by your commanders, and most of all -- attack the enemies of our nation wherever you might find them.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty|And what about my duties as a mercenary?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle|Can I hold any fortresses I may take?

dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|How much will you pay me for my service?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Sounds good. I wish to enter your service as a mercenary.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_reject|I'm sorry, but my sword is not for hire.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my loyal subjects can own lands and fortresses in my realm. A mercenary cannot be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for a time, you can swear homage to me and become my subject. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.

dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I must send a letter to {s13}, who should currently be at {s4}. If you will be heading in that direction, would you kindly deliver it to him? The letter must be in his hands within 30 days.

dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} any time soon, {s65}. You had best send it with a courier.

dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|Thank you, {playername}. Here is the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, very well then. I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2|Hmm, is this how you respond to a polite request for a small favor? Poor show, {playername}. I am surprised that you would take offence.

dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Forgive my temper, {s65}. I will deliver your letter.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3:close_window|Indeed. I will remember...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need a letter delivered to {s13} of {s15}, who is currently at {s4}. If you are traveling in that direction, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him within 40 days.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is one small matter... My {s17} {s13} is due to visit her relatives at {s14}. In fact, the visit has been postponed several times already, what with all the trouble on the roads -- but this time she is adamant about going. So I would at least like to make sure she's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername}, and I would be very grateful if you could escort her to {s14} and make sure she arrives safely.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told|A group of bandits have taken refuge in my village of {s1}. They plunder the nearby farms, feasting upon my cattle and stealing my taxes.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_raise_troops|It shames me to say this, {playername}, but I was inspecting my soldiers the other day, and found several who scarcely know which end of the sword to hold. {s44} You are a warrior of some renown, {playername}.

dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You have taken a great weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to convey these recruits to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help cover your expenses. Here, take this purse, and my thanks for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I should have expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_collect_taxes_told|You probably know that I am the lord of the {reg9?town:village} of {s3}. However, it has been months since {s3} has delivered its taxes and rents due to me, its rightful lord. Apparently, the populace there has grown unruly of late, and I shall have to send someone there to remind them of their obligations. And to... persuade them if they refuse to listen to reason. If you go there and raise the taxes they owe, I shall grant you one-fifth of everything you collect.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted|A fair offer, {s65}. We have an agreement.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected|Forgive me, but I don't have the time.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted:close_window|Welcome news, {playername}. I shall entrust this matter to you. Remember, those {reg9?townsmen:peasants} are foxes and devils. They will make every excuse not to pay me my rightful incomes. Do not listen to their lies.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, very well then. Well, good luck to you.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with -- it involves the lawless villain known as {s4}. He murdered one of my men, and has been on the run from justice ever since. I cannot afford to let him get away with this, so I've put a bounty of 300 thaler on his head. Some friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down there and give him what he deserves -- and claim the bounty for yourself!
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I shall hunt down this snake, and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|Marvelous, {playername}. I would be most grateful to you, as will the family of the man he murdered. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}. I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around that might get the job done...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant|The wretched truth is that I owe a considerable sum of money to one of the merchants here in {s3}. I have no intention of paying it back, of course, but that loud-mouthed fool is making a terrible fuss about it. He even had the audacity to come and threaten me with a letter of complaint to the trade guilds and bankers. Why, he would ruin my reputation! So I need a {man/woman} I can trust, someone who will guarantee the man's silence. For good.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant|Worry not, he shan't breathe another word.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town|I have a delicate matter which needs tending to, {playername} -- and there is no one I can trust to handle it for me. The fact is that I have placed a spy in {s13} to keep an eye on things for me, and report anything that might warrant my attention. Every week I send someone to collect the spy's reports and bring them back here to me. The job is yours if you want it.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted|Sounds interesting -- a bit of espionage. Count me in.

dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Excellent! Make your way to {s13} as soon as you can. The spy will be waiting.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2|{s13} is heavily defended. How can I even get close without being noticed?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|You shall have to use stealth. Take care to avoid enemy strongholds, villages, and patrols -- and don't bring too many men with you. If you fail to sneak in the first time, wait a while for the garrison to lower its guard again, or you may have a difficult time infiltrating the town.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3|How will I recognize the spy?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Once you arrive in {s13}, speak with the locals -- the spy will be one of them. If you think you've found the spy, say the phrase '{s11}' The spy will respond with the phrase '{s12}'. Thus you will know the other, and {reg7?she:he} will give you any information {reg7?she:he}'s gathered in my service.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4|Will I be paid for my labors?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Of course, I have plenty of silver in my coffers for loyal {men/women} such as yourself. Do well by me, {playername}, and you shall rise high.

dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end:lord_pretalk|Good luck, {playername}. Remember, the secret phrase is '{s11}' and the counterphrase is '{s12}'. Bring any reports back to me, and I shall reward you with an open hand.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername} -- but I strongly advise you to forget anything I might have mentioned about any spies. I have no such people in my employ, and I never have. And no one would ever find me making use of such men. Remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We have let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they grow stronger with each passing day, and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say we should wage war on them before it's too late! Unfortunately, some of the bleeding hearts among our realm's lords are blocking the declaration of war. -- Witless cowards with no stomach for blood!
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, sir. Peace is preferable to war.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3|Ah, 'tis good to hear a like-minded soul! As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername} -- a little bit of provocation. The dogs in {s13} are very fond of their merchant carts, and rely on them overmuch. If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage some of their carts, they would have ample motive to declare war on us. And then, well, even the cowards amongst us would be forced to rise up -- if only to defend themselves. So what say you? Are you interested?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4|Why do you ask me? Are your own men incapable of dealing with a few merchants?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of my subjects would not look too fondly upon a ruler who would incite war without their consent. Many of them are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young, well-liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And then of course I will throw my support behind you and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few of our high and mighty might be upset at your endeavor, but I am sure you won't be terribly bothered with that.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|Then I will go and raid those carts at your behest.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2|I don't like this. Find yourself someone else to take the blame for your schemes.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! Now, if I were you, I'd try to capture and loot at least {reg13} caravan carts, to make sure you really infuriate those fools in {s13}. With that done, return to me -- and make sure you keep away from their patrols. If they catch you, our plan will certainly fail, and you'll be facing a long time in their prisons. Go on now, and good luck to you -- and good hunting!
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, you think so? But how long will your precious peace last? Not long, believe me.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hmm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was mistaken.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine! I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me! From what I've been hearing, they're running toward {s3} as fast as they can, and they've split up into three groups in an attempt to avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups, and take them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hung for attempting to escape, but we'll need every hand for the upcoming harvest. I suppose I'll have to let them off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have it on good authority that there is a man in this very town who is actually an enemy spy. He must be seized and hanged for his impudence -- but we also believe that very soon he will be leaving town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and might tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, or he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must swiftly ambush and arrest them both, and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, I don't have the time for this.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good! I'm sure I can count on you. One of my men will point out the spy for you when he leaves, so you'll know who to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|What a shame. Ah well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be just the one who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the nobles of {s13} and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange for a relative of mine who is currently being held by {s13}. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you target will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for that kind of fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I am no kidnapper.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a job for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow}, and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend me {reg3?her:his} services for a while?

dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, or a week at the most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected|I am sorry, but I cannot do without {s3} for a whole week.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted:close_window|I cannot thank you enough, {playername}. Worry not, your companion shall be returned to you with all due haste.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's most unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} thaler, to be precise. He was supposed to pay it back within the month, but I haven't received a copper from him since, and this was months ago. If you could collect the debt from him on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the amount for your trouble. What say you?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2|Do you know where I can find {s3}, {s65}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3|If you leave now and move quickly, you should be able to find him at {s4}. I've little doubt that he will be suitably embarrassed by his conduct, and will give you all the money he owes.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted|Then I will make sure {s3} returns the debt.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected|Forgive me, {s65}, but I believe it better to collect one's own debts in person.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted:close_window|You have made me very happy, {playername}. Please, talk to {s3}, and don't let him off unless he returns my money.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected:lord_pretalk|Perhaps you are right, {playername}. Ah, I suppose I'm never getting that money back...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander|I tell you, that blubbering fool {s13} is not fit to rule {s14}. God knows he would be divested of his lands in an instant, were it not for one of his loyal subjects, {s15}. As long as he has {s15} aiding him, taking him down will be a difficult job indeed. So I shall need to get {s15} out of the picture -- and I have a plan to do just that... With your help, naturally.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2|I am all ears, {s66}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|I don't wish to involve myself in anything dishonorable against {s15}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected:lord_pretalk|Dishonorable? Bah! I was hoping I could count on you, {playername}, but you've shown me what a fool I was to entertain such hopes. I shall have to find someone else -- someone whose loyalty I can trust.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a letter addressed to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates him in a plan to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favor.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I shall not sully myself with such dishonorable schemes.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You shall take the letter to {s14}, convey it to one of your soldiers, and instruct him to deliver it to {s15}. Meanwhile, I shall have one of my spies inform the town garrison, so that your man will be arrested along the way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of him, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, so the fool will most likely believe the whole charade, and turn upon one of his allies.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7|Is that all?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one other matter... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. He may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see what's right in front of him. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of our soldiers, if not to die at our orders?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Very well, a {s8} it shall be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I'll not sacrifice one of my best men.

dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_rejected|I fear I cannot accept such a mission at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted:close_window|Excellent, {playername}, excellent. Do not fail me.
dlga_lord_mission_rejected:close_window|Is that so? Well, I suppose you're just not up to the task. I shall have to look for someone of firmer mettle.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave_prison|I must leave now.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave|I must hurry...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave.1|I beg my leave of you.
dlga_lord_leave:lord_leave_give_quest|Before you go, {playername}, I have something to ask of you... We may be enemies in this war, but I pray that you believe, as I do, that we can still treat each other with civility and respect. Thus I hoped that you might be kind enough to assist me in a matter of great importance.
dlga_lord_leave_give_quest:enemy_lord_tell_mission|I am listening.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here -- he was once a mighty warrior, but now he has grown deathly ill. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound, and unless he is seen to by a doctor soon, he will surely die. This man is most dear to me, {playername}, but he's as stubborn as a hog and refuses to allow anyone look at his injury. Seems he doesn't trust any of the physicians here. But I've heard that you have a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look at him, {reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to the necessary surgery. Please, I would be deeply indebted to you if you would but grant me this request.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:close_window|ERROR: MATCHED WITH QUEST: {s7}.
dlga_lord_leave_prison:close_window|We shall meet again.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window|Of course, {playername}. Farewell.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.1|Good journeys to you, {playername}.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.2|Farewell.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.3|We shall meet again.
dlga_member_chat:lady_journey_1|Are you enjoying your travels, {s65}?
dlga_lady_journey_1:close_window|I am doing quite fine, {playername}. Thank you for your concern.
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how good it is to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I should hope he never forgets his humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's but little compared to what you've done for me.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2|It will just have to do.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.2|Please, {s65}, no reward is necessary.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you demanded satisfaction from {s13} to defend my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for it.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. It was the attempt that mattered, not the outcome. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honor. This alone will convince many of my innocence.
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope that someday we shall meet once more.
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_generic_mission_succeeded|Oh, {playername}, you have returned him to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s17}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_lady_generic_mission_succeeded:lady_pretalk|'Tis always an honor to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet|I am {playername}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet.1|My name is {playername}.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end|{playername}? I do not believe I've heard of you before.
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk|Can I help you with anything?
dlga_start:lady_talk|Yes?
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk|Anything else?
dlga_lady_talk:lady_ask_for_quest|Is there anything I can do to win your favor?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk|I don't have anything else for you to do right now.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... He is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate his ransom, but it is simply too high. We could never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows that {s13} would rather spend his life in prison than make us destitute. Instead I have come up with a plan to get him out of there, but it requires someone else to make a great sacrifice, and thus far my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.1|My poor {s17}, {s13}, is a prisoner in the {s14} dungeons. The only way we can talk to each other is by exchanging letters whenever we can, but the journey is so dangerous that we have little opportunity to do so. Please, would you deliver a letter for me?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Oh, {playername}! You know little of my troubles, and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Tell me what the matter is, and I may be able to lend you my aid.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Very well... In his life, my husband has... made certain enemies, {playername}. Of these, perhaps the most insidious is {s13}. He goes around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honor at every turn! He cannot harm my husband directly, so he slanders me instead, in the hopes of ruining our good name. One shudders to hear the awful things he has said! If only there were someone brave enough to make him recant his slander... but {s13} is quite skilled with both the saber and the pistol, and he's widely feared...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|I fear him not, {s65}, my lady. I shall force his lies back down his throat!
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! I could never ask you to defend my honor, {playername}! But... you seem so sure of yourself... If you could do this, I would be forever in your debt. It would mean so much if you would defend my honor. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favor go with you.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If he's that dangerous, perhaps it would be better to simply ignore him...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Yes, I suppose you're right, {playername}. I should let go of my silly childhood ideas of chivalry and honor. People are not like that... not anymore. Farewell.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, I've no need for a champion right now.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish, {s65}. It shall be done.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_rejected|{s66}, I fear I cannot help you right now.
dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {gentleman/lady}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me.
dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please -- leave me. I have some important embroidery to catch up on.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a noble. Can you help me?
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am very sorry.
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I see you've gotten yourself on somebody's bad side. Very well, with whom do you want to restore your relations?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well, yes, I can try to help you with this. I'm sure a few expensive gifts would make {s10} look upon you more favorably.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} thaler. But if you could afford to spend {reg11} thaler on the gift, it would make a very fine impression on {reg4?her:him}. If you might go further, up to {reg12} thaler, this would really help smooth things over.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} thaler would do perfectly.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Perhaps I can afford {reg11} thaler.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} thaler.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford any such gifts at the moment.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I shall choose an appropriate gift for you, and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madam.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I'm afraid I can't be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_leave|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lady_leave:close_window|Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_convince_begin:convince_options|I still don't see why I should go along with what you're asking of me.
dlga_convince_options:convince_bribe|Then I'll make it worth your while. ({reg8} thaler)
dlga_convince_options:convince_friendship|Please, do it for the sake of our friendship. (-{reg9} to relation)
dlga_convince_options:convince_persuade_begin|Let me try and convince you... (Persuasion)
dlga_convince_options:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_convince_bribe:convince_bribe_verify|Mmm, a generous gift to my coffers would certainly help matters... {reg8} thaler should do it. And I'll go with your suggestion.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_cant_afford|I'm afraid my finances do not permit me to offer such a gift.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_goon|Very well, please accept these {reg8} thaler.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_begin|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_convince_bribe_cant_afford:convince_options|Ah. In that case, there is little I can do, unless you have some further argument to make...
dlga_convince_bribe_goon:convince_accept|Good {playername}! Consider this matter decided!
dlga_convince_friendship:convince_friendship_verify|You've done well by me in the past, {playername}, and for that I will go along with your request, but know that I do not like your using our relationship this way.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:convince_friendship_go_on|I am sorry, my friend, but I need your help in this.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:lord_pretalk|If it will not please you, then I shall try something else.
dlga_convince_friendship_go_on:convince_accept|All right then, {playername}, I will accept this for your sake. But remember, you owe me for this.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk|I don't think I owe you such a favor {playername}. I see no reason to accept this, even for you.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk.1|Is this some kind of a joke? You've some nerve asking me for favors, {playername} -- and let me assure you you'll receive none.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:convince_persuade_begin_2|Very well. Make your case.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_persuade|Attempt to persuade...
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_begin|Try another way...
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:lord_pretalk|By God's grace, {playername}! I am tired of listening to you. Your arguments are clearly lacking.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_accept|All right, all right. You have convinced me. I'll go ahead with what you suggest.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You've a point, {playername}, I'll admit that much. However I am not yet convinced that I should do as you bid.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've a lot of arguments, but none of them are truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask makes even less sense now than it did before.
dlga_start:siege_won_seneschal_1|I must congratulate you on your victory, my {lord/lady}. Welcome to {s1}. We, the caretakers of this fortress, are at your service.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_1:siege_won_seneschal_2|Are you the steward?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {lord/lady}. I have always served the masters of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on. Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {lord/lady} of this place. Now -- I do hope you intend to keep me on as steward? I promise you will not be disappointed.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to your plans for the fortress?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to some noble.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|Oh, you might do any number of things my {lord/lady}. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the fortress from any immediate counterattacks. Then you could request an audience with some wealthy noble, and ask him to make you an offer on the fortress. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a sovereign and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to such a fortress. Both you and {s1} would become very attractive targets for every man out there with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a sovereign? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold, and seize it for themselves at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, you shall find me in the great hall. 
dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day, {sir/madam}. I do not believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the steward of {s1}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1a|A pleasure to meet you, {s65}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a steward's duties are many, {sire/my lady}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, manage the fortress storerooms, deal with the local peasantry, take care of fortress staff, arrange supplies for the garrison... In short, all the mundane matters of this fief are my responsibility, which I carry out on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers, of course.
dlga_start:seneschal_talk|Good day, {sir/madam}.
dlga_seneschal_pretalk:seneschal_talk|Will there be anything else?
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_something|I would like to ask you a question...
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_about_someone|I wish to know more about someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone:seneschal_ask_about_someone_2|Perhaps I might be able to help. Who did you have in mind?
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_ask_about_someone_3|{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_pretalk|Return...

dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_relation:seneschal_ask_about_someone_4|{reg1?She:He} hates {s51}.
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_4:seneschal_ask_about_someone_relation|Where does {s1} stand with others?
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_4:seneschal_pretalk|My thanks, this was helpful.
dlga_seneschal_talk:close_window|I must take my leave of you now. Farewell.
dlga_seneschal_ask_something:seneschal_ask_something_2|I'll do what I can to help, of course. What is it you wish to ask?
dlga_seneschal_ask_something_2:seneschal_ask_location|Perhaps you know where I might find someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location:seneschal_ask_location_2|Well, a man in my position does hear a lot of things. Who is it that you seek?
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_ask_location_3|{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_pretalk|Return...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_3:seneschal_pretalk|{s1}
dlga_start:close_window.4|I see the walls of {s3} right ahead! We arrive a last. Here is your reward, {reg3} thaler -- I hope it is enough! And I do hope we meet again.
dlga_start:talk_caravan_escort|We've made it this far... Is everything clear up ahead?
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2a|There might be bandits nearby. Stay close.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2a:close_window|Trust me, {playername}, we're already staying as close to you as we can. Lead the way.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2b|No sign of trouble, we can breathe easy.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2b:close_window|I'll breathe easy when we reach {s1}, and not a moment sooner. Let's keep moving.
dlga_start:merchant_talk|What do you want? We paid our toll to you less than three days ago.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.1|Hail, friend.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.2|What do you want? We are but simple merchants. We've no quarrel with you. Leave us be.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.3|Be warned, knave! This caravan is under the protection of {s9}. Step out of our way or face his fury!
dlga_start:merchant_talk.4|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_merchant_pretalk:merchant_talk|Anything else?
dlga_merchant_talk:caravan_start_war_quest_1|You are trespassing in {s17} territory. I am confiscating these carts and all their goods!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_1:caravan_start_war_quest_2|What? What nonsense is this? We are nowhere near your territory, {mate/wench}, and besides, we have a peace treaty with {s17}!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:merchant_attack|We'll see about that! Defend yourselves!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:close_window|Never mind, 'twas but a joke. Farewell.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_talk_offer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer:merchant_talk_offer_2|What is it?
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:caravan_offer_protection|I can escort you to your destination, for a price.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:merchant_pretalk|Return...
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_demand|Hold, there, my good men.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_carried_items|What are you carrying?
dlga_merchant_carried_items:merchant_talk|{s64}, we are carrying {reg1} {s1} to {s2}.
dlga_merchant_demand:merchant_demand_2|What do you want?
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_demand_toll|You must pay a toll to pass here!
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2|Please, I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} thaler -- just let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2.1|I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} thaler if you'll let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_demand_toll_accept|Agreed, hand it over and you may go in peace.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_accept:close_window|Very well then. Here's {reg6} thaler. 
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_pretalk|I changed my mind. I can't take your money.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_attack|No, I think I shall take -- everything! [Attack]
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_attack_begin|Hand over your gold and valuables -- now!
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_pretalk|No. Forget it.
dlga_merchant_attack_begin:merchant_attack_verify|Are you robbing us?
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack_verify_norob|Robbing you? No, no! It was only a joke.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify_norob:close_window|God, don't joke about that, {lad/lass}. For a moment I thought we were in real trouble.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack|Of course I'm robbing you. Now hand over your goods.
dlga_merchant_attack:close_window|Damn you, you won't get anything from us without a fight!
dlga_caravan_offer_protection:caravan_offer_protection_2|These roads are dangerous indeed. One can never have enough protection.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:close_window|An escort? We're almost there already! Thank you for the offer, though.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:caravan_offer_protection_3|We are heading to {s1}. I will pay you {reg2} thaler if you will escort us there.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4|Agreed.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4:caravan_offer_protection_5|You must stay close to us along the way. We'll greatly need your help if we are ambushed by bandits.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_5:caravan_offer_protection_6|Don't worry, you can trust me.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_6:close_window|Good. You can come and collect your money when we're within sight of {s1}. Alright then, let's get underway.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4b|Return...
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4b:close_window|Perhaps another time, then.
dlga_merchant_talk:talk_caravan_enemy_2|Not so fast. First, hand over all your goods and money.
dlga_talk_caravan_enemy_2:close_window|Never! It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!
dlga_merchant_talk:close_window|Leave...
dlga_start:prison_guard_players|Good day, my {lord/lady}. Will you be visiting the prison?
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window|Yes. Unlock the door.
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window.1|No, not now.
dlga_start:prison_guard_talk|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_ask_prisoners|Who is imprisoned here?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_visit_prison|I want to speak with prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_ask_prisoners:prison_guard_talk|Currently, {s51} {reg1?are:is} imprisoned here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {sir/madam}. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You shall need permission from our lord to talk to the prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll do that.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were in charge here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh, you're quite right -- I'm the man in charge. But I still can't let you into the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse with 100 thaler a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_5:close_window|Ah! I was looking for that all day. How good of you to return it, {sir/madam}. Well, now that I know what an honest {fellow/lady} you are, there can be no harm in letting you inside for a short while.
dlga_prison_guard_talk:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_players|Your orders, my {lord/lady}?
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window|Open the door. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window.1|Return...
dlga_start:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1|Get out of my sight, beggar! You stink!
dlga_start:close_window.5|Begone and tempt not my patience, beggar!
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_2|I wish to enter the hall and speak to the lord.

dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:castle_guard_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_2|You may go in, but you must leave your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the lord's hall.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:close_window|Here then, take my arms. I shall go in.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_2b|No, I give my arms to no one.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2b:close_window|Then you cannot go in.

dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_3:local_merchant_mercy_yes_4|Yes, of course. I'll do just as you say.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_4:local_merchant_mercy_yes_5|And if my lord hears so much as a whisper on this matter, then I shall return for you, and it won't matter how much you scream for mercy. Do I make myself clear?

dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_6:close_window|Good. Go now, before I change my mind.
dlga_start:fugitive_1|Yes, what do you want?
dlga_fugitive_1:fugitive_2|I am looking for a murderer by the name of {s4}. You fit his description.
dlga_fugitive_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
dlga_fugitive_2:fugitive_3|I do not know what you are talking about {sir/madam}. I assure you, I am just another one of the people who lives here.

dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2|What do you mean {sir/madam}?
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3|There's a trap set up for you in the town. {s3} ordered me to sacrifice one of my chosen warriors to fool the enemy -- but he will just need to find another way.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3:close_window|Thank you, {sir/madam}. I would follow you to the gates of hell, as you well know. But this would not have been a noble death.

dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_caught|Good day {sir/madam}. We were just heading back to {s5}, but I fear we lost our way.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_go_back|Do not test my patience. You are going back now!
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, if you are that eager to go, then go.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_again_return|We are on our way back to {s5} {sir/madam}.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2|Make haste now. The sooner you return the better.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2.1|Good. Keep moving.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2:close_window|Yes sir. As you wish.
dlga_start:looting_bandits_talk|If you want to save your caravan you have to pay us.
dlga_looting_bandits_talk:looting_bandits_barter_3b|I only pay those who deserve payment!
dlga_looting_bandits_talk:looting_bandits_barter|There's no need to fight. I am ready to pay.
dlga_looting_bandits_barter:looting_bandits_barter_2|Good. You are clever. Pay us {reg5} thaler, and we will leave you and your caravan.
dlga_looting_bandits_barter_2:looting_bandits_barter_3a|All right, here's your {reg5} thaler.
dlga_looting_bandits_barter_2:looting_bandits_barter_3b|I don't have that much money with me.
dlga_looting_bandits_barter_3b:close_window|Too bad. Now we'll have to take everything you are carrying as payment.
dlga_looting_bandits_barter_3a:close_window|Ha ha! Good. Now take your caravan and go.
dlga_start:deserter_paid_talk|What do you want? You want to pay us some more money?
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2a|Sorry to trouble you. I'll be on my way now.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2a:close_window|Yeah. Stop fooling around here and go make some money. I want to see that purse full next time I see you.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2b|No. This time it's your turn to pay me!
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2b:close_window|What is this nonsense? You want trouble?! You've got it!
dlga_start:deserter_talk|We are free, and from now on we will fight only for ourselves.^ Now give us your silver, or taste our steel.
dlga_deserter_talk:close_window|I only pay those who deserve payment!
dlga_deserter_talk:deserter_barter|There's no need to fight. I am ready to pay.
dlga_deserter_barter:deserter_barter_2|Good. You are clever. Pay us {reg5} thaler, and you can go.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3a|All right, here's your {reg5} thaler.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3b|I don't have that much money with me.
dlga_deserter_barter_3b:close_window|Too bad. Then we'll have to sell you to the slavers.
dlga_deserter_barter_3a:close_window|Ha ha! Good. Now go.
dlga_start:tavernkeeper_talk|Good day my dear {sir/lady}. How can I help you?
dlga_tavernkeeper_pretalk:tavernkeeper_talk|Anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine:tavernkeeper_pretalk|At last! My stores were nearly depleted. I had paid for the {s4} in advance. Here, take these {reg5} thaler. That should cover you expenses. And give {s9} my regards. I'll put in a good word for you next time I speak with him.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost some of the cargo along the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Attacked by bandits, eh? You're lucky they let you live. I'm afraid I can pay you no more than {reg5} thaler for this. And I will let the seller know that my order was not delivered in full. You will probably be charged for this loss.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost the cargo along the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What? I have been waiting for that {s4} for weeks! And now you are telling me that you lost it?! You may rest assured that {s1} will hear all about this!
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks|I'd like to buy every man who enters here tonight a jar of your best wine.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2|Of course, {my lord/my lady}. I reckon {reg5} thaler should be enough for that. What should I tell the lads?
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Tell everyone of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Don't worry {sir/madam}. Your name will be cheered and toasted here all night.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Actually, never mind. Cancel that order.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:oim_tavern_rich_visitor|I would have some wine, I suppose... And perhaps I might spend the night...
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I think it's about time I leave now.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Good day, {sir/madam}. I suppose I could be of use to you...
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|How could you be of use to me, anyway?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|You know what me do for a living, no? Ah, listen then... Me broker ransom for prisoners. Me travels long, long way -- from the salt mines to the slave markets on the coast... Along the way, me comes across some misters dragging captive men. Me buys prisoners and sell to the slavers. You have prisoners to sell, my lord? I pay good price, you know.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then me spin them a sad-sad tale -- a life on the galleys. Suddenly even very poor peasants digs treasures out of his cowshed, oh my!
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What would you pay for a prisoner?
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It vary. Me have a good nose for ransoms. One look at the man can tell me whether they goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real monies of course is the gentry... Me know every land-owning house here, the estates, the heraldry, their offspring, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course, my {lord/lady}, of course. Keep the silver buried somewhere deep, and tell a loyal servant what to do when you get captured.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.

dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|My {lord/lady}, you have some to sell, and I will gladly buy!
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got some to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_intro_2|Tell me about what you do again.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg|Have you perhaps heard of a Russian Boyarina captured recently?

dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Somehow I feel you are the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me, {sir/madam}. I travel much, and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a small price, of course.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. It's a small world, as they say. I thought you might like to know.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I'm not particularly interested.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|There's seldom a break from the bitter wars... Well, at least that makes it a good place to be, for daring people such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, perhaps even amass a fortune, or gain great power.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Interesting... Tell me more.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|All right, I understand. Now I must go...
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already...
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4.1|Nations engaged in war will pay good money for mercenaries. If you've done even a bit of fighting, speaking with one of the sovereigns will probably result in a mercenary contract. However, the real rewards come if you can manage to become a sworn subject of one of these sovereigns. Subjects can own villages, fortresses, and towns -- and grow wealthy from the taxes and revenues of their estates. Normally only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in times of war, a regent will not hesitate to accept as his confidant someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|Nowadays there is no rest for the kings! Each has his own rivals, other men born to the right family, who might go around stirring up trouble, claiming a right to the throne. If these men find supporters, they could easily start civil wars, and perhaps even win the crown one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find men who hold such claims?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I have heard enough already. Thank you.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life is in danger in his own country, of course. Therefore, they usually travel constantly through the towns and cities of their nation, raising their supporters. I often hear rumors about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something in return for such a service.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.

dlga_start:close_window.18|TODO: Hello. I am a minstrel. (Not implemented yet)
dlga_start:farmer_from_bandit_village_1|{My lord/Madam}, you look like a seasoned warrior, and one who could help us. Will you hear my plea?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2|What is the matter, my good man?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2.1|What are you blubbering about peasant? Out with it!
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_2:farmer_from_bandit_village_3|A band of brigands has taken refuge in our village. They take everything we have, force us to serve them, and do us much evil. If one of us so much as breathes a word against them, they kill the poor soul on the spot. Our lives have become unbearable. I risked my skin running away to find someone who can help us.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_3:farmer_from_bandit_village_4|Why don't you just go to your master? He should take care of these vermin.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_4:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|I did, {sir/madam}, but our lord's men did not let me see him, and said he was occupied with more important matters -- and that we should deal with our own problem ourselves. Please {sir/madam}, you look like a {man/lady} of valor and a fearsome warrior, and you have no doubt many friends and soldiers in your service. If there is anyone who can help us, it's you.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted|Very well, I'll help you. Where is this village?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_denied|I can't be bothered with this right now.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_barter|Why would I fight these bandits? What's in it for me?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted:close_window|God bless you, {sir/madam}. Our village is {s7}. It is not too far from here.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_denied:close_window|As you say {sir/madam}. Forgive me for bothering you.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_barter:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|We are but poor farmers {sir/madam}, and the bandits have already taken most of what we have in this world. But we'll be glad to share with you whatever we have left!
dlga_start:close_window.19|Thank you for helping us {sir/madam}. Crush those bandits!
dlga_start:mercenary_tavern_talk|Do you have a need for mercenaries, {sir/madam}? {reg3?Me and {reg4?{reg3} of my mates:one of my mates} are:I am} looking for a famed commander. We'll join you for {reg5} thaler.
dlga_start:mercenary_after_recruited|Any orders, {sir/madam}?
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2|Make your preparations. We'll move at dawn.
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2.1|Take your time. We'll be staying in this town for a while.
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited_2:close_window|Yes, {sir/madam}. We'll be ready as soon as you give us the word.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire|All right. For fine swordsmen I would not begrudge {reg5} thaler.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire.1|All right. But I can only hire {reg6} of you. Here is {reg5} thaler.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk_hire:close_window|{s17}
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead|Alas, I can't afford to hire any more men right now.
dlga_tavern_mercenary_cant_lead:close_window|That's a pity. Well, {reg3?we will:I will} be lingering here a while yet, if you need to hire anyone.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead.1|It's a good offer, but I can't take on any more men right now.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|I don't need any more men right now.
dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well believe you me, you won't survive long here unless you know how to get yourself out of a tight spot.
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... earned my scars in the old wars. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about fighting, feel free to ask me.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I'd like to start practicing.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager to train. Let's see what you can do.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've got a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, losses are often just as valuable as victories. Shake the stars out of your head and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Hello there. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready to practice.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I must leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about how I can defend myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about cavalry attacks.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know just about all I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing fighters need to know is how to defend themselves. Keeping out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than dealing harm to others. Anybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell the story.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] While you're defending yourself like this, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you still need to watch for strikes from the sides and rear.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|If you don't have a shield, you'll have to block with your weapon. It's a bit more difficult than defending with a shield, but it only takes a little practice. When defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you can block against either overhead swings, side swings, or thrusts. Therefore you have to watch your opponent carefully, and start to block only AFTER he starts his attack. This way you can block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against -- and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. A strong attack is the best defense, as they say. A common tactic is to take an offensive stance and ready your weapon for attack, waiting for just the right moment to swing. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that your opponent may see that, and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you should break your attack and quickly attack from another direction. [You can cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|Oh, so if my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break off the attack, and attack from another direction?
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction of your attack is a critical skill. There are four main directions you can use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. Use each one wisely. [To control your swing direction with the default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Ah, very good question. A horse is the warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power, and initiative. Many weapons become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they can take down an opponent in a single hit. [To use a couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing any attack or defense buttons. After you reach a certain speed, you'll automatically lower your lance. Then just try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each more challenging than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all the stages of training. But if you wish, you can still practice. Are you ready for more?
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Well done, {lad/lass}. With that victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on, your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street -- so keep on your toes.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Excellent, my {lad/lass}. You have risen to the third training level. From now on, your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These fellows know some dirty tricks, so keep up your defenses.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and a sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have ever trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such promising talent. You have passed all the training levels. You can now boast that you have been trained by the master of the training field.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Thank you for the lesson, master.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments! And, don't forget -- if ever you want to practice your swordsmanship, just come say the word.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. What's that now? Wondering how many fights 'til the next round? Only {reg8} more. Well, are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_ready_to_fight|Yes, I'm ready.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Get out there, then. Good luck.
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, You'll never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_start:mayor_begin|Good day, my lord.
dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the mayor of the town.
dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat, bringing {s14} and {s15} to the peace table -- and you made it happen! In doing this, you have saved our town from disaster, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. Know that the townspeople of {s19} will be true to our word. We are ready to pay the {reg12} thaler we promised.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We already gathered the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} thaler together with our most sincere thanks. The people of our town will never forget your help.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordinary person, {sir/madam}, and it is an honor to have known you. You not only did you accomplish the impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it! Very well, I will not insist, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nicely done, {playername}! You made short work of those lawless dogs! Thank you kindly for all your help -- and please accept this bounty of 150 thaler.
dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty was 40 thaler for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here's your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters are no longer a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now. If there's any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town! I say this happily concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Is there anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send my men to collect it. I still need {reg1} thaler worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, {sir/madam}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} thaler worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here's the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any still remain. Thank you for your help -- I won't forget it.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}! I hear you delivered the cattle! I'll tell all the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} thaler.
dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a difficult time explaining this to the owner of that herd, {sir/madam}. What do you have to say for yourself?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry, but I was attacked on the way.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded compensation for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 thaler. So you now owe me that money.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|Oh my dear {playername}. I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter. Please take these {reg8} thaler that I promised you. My friend wished he could give you more, but paying that ransom has brought him to his knees.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|I have heard the stories of your deeds, and you certainly gave those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say! Here is your reward: {reg5} thaler. I would like to give you more, but those bandits have nearly bled my dry.
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchant guild {reg1} thaler. I'd better collect that now.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum just now.
dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid I can't deal with you. Guild rules, you see... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} thaler. And know that we'll be charging interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
dlga_mayor_talk:oim_lendliz_giving_goods|Good day to you. I come to collect some supplies for Naum Vasiliev. Here is the deed...
dlga_prison_guard_talk:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_mayor_talk|I come from the warlord. Here is the deed...
dlga_mayor_talk:ms_talk_to_elder_to_construct|I would like to talk about developing the city.
dlga_mayor_talk:oim_guild_master_talk|I'd like to talk about trade...
dlga_mayor_talk:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr|I have an assignment for you from Radziwill.
dlga_mayor_talk:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given|Here is a cure for a failing memory...
dlga_mayor_talk:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_dlg_init|I want to talk about the archives...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|Leave...
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the mayor of the town. You may say that I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some good, honest work.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's protector is {s10}. We levy judgments and collect taxes in his name. However, we handle ourselves in most matters that concern us. As the town's mayor I have the authority to decide most cases.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, so you want to reconsider. Very well...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you do not fail. In that case, I shall have to demand you repay the value of the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days. Tell me if you decide to take it.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it -- and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try to make their fortune by looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need someone to teach these bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming the countryside, probably trying to rob more of our good people. Kill or capture the bastards -- I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 thaler for every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Would something like that suit you?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the tavern in {s4}. If you can take {reg5} units of {s6} to {s4} within the next 7 days, you'll earn yourself {reg8} thaler. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will make the delivery.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo just now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Would something like that suit you?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am planning to send carts of goods to {s8}. However, with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can get these carts to {s8} before 15 days have passed, you will earn {reg8} thaler. Of course, your party must be at least {reg4} strong, if you hope to offer them any protection.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|All right. I will take the job.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall.1|Sorry. I can't take that on just now.
dlga_start:close_window.20|We can get the rest of the way ourselves. Thank you.
dlga_start:close_window.21|Well, there's {s21} down the way. We can cover the rest of the road ourselves. Here's your pay... {reg14} thaler. Thanks for the escort. Good luck.
dlga_start:merchant_caravan_intro_1|You must be our escort, right?
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_1:merchant_caravan_intro_2|Yes. My name is {playername}. I'm here to lead you to {s1}.
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_2:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Well, It is good to know we won't be traveling alone. What do would your instructions be now?
dlga_start:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Eh, so we've made it this far... What do you want us to do?
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you by the safest route.
dlga_merchant_caravan_follow_lead:close_window|Alright. We'll be right behind you.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_stay_here|You stay here for a while. I'll go ahead and check the road.
dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|Actually, I've been looking for a fellow like you. You see, there's this group of particularly troublesome bandits, who have infested the environs of our town, and are preying on my trade carts. So far, they've avoided all the soldiers and the militias, and if someone doesn't stop them soon, I'll be ruined...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} thaler, if you will hunt down these troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work, but I think you might be just the one to do it. What do you say?
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken_bandits|All right. I will hunt down those bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken_bandits:close_window|You will? It does my heart good to hear you say that. Good luck to you!
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for a reliable assistant to undertake an important mission. A group of bandits have kidnapped the daughter of a friend of mine and are holding her for ransom. My friend is ready to pay them, but we need someone to take the money to those rascals -- and bring the girl back safely.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_brief|The bandits are asking for {reg12} thaler, which I will hand over to you as soon as you accept the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits, who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. The bastards said that they'll kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by then. You will get your pay of {reg8} thaler after you bring the girl safely back here.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_taken|Alright. I will take the ransom money to the bandits and bring back the girl.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_taken:close_window|Good. I knew we could count on you for this. Here is the ransom money, all {reg12} thaler. Count it before you take it. And please, don't attempt to do anything rash. Keep in mind that the girl's life is more important than anything else...
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have the time for this right now.
dlga_start:close_window.22|Thank you for saving my life, {sir/madam}! It has been horrible here...
dlga_kidnapped_girl_liberated_map:kidnapped_girl_liberated_map_2a|Yes. Come with me. We're going home.

dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5b:close_window|Do you expect me to believe that? You are going to repay that ransom fee!
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|This war between {s15} and {s14} has brought our town to the verge of ruin. Our carts are raided before they can reach their destination. Our merchants are afraid to leave the safety of the town walls. And as if that isn't enough, the taxes we are charged to maintain the war have deprived us of our last scraps of savings. We pray for peace, but we will not be able to hold out much longer.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_brief|You are right. But who can stop this madness called war?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty to help the nobles in their war efforts. You shouldn't complain about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for greed and dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who bear the real burden. But obviously you don't want to hear about that.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful nobles on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. These men urge the others not to heed to the words of sensible men, but to keep fighting. While these leaders remain influential, no peace settlement can be reached.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5|They are {s12} of the {s15} and {s13} of the {s14}. Until they change their ways or lose their influence, there is little chance of peace between the two sides.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6.1|It seems a hopeless case...
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person could persuade one or both of them to accept peace. And even if that fails, it might be possible to see that they are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they were taken captive, they would lose their influence, and they could no longer oppose peace... What do you think?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|It seems difficult. But I will try.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.1|If the price is right, I may be able to help.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.2|Forget it. This is not my concern.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|Most of the merchants in the town will gladly open up their purses to support such a plan. I think we can collect {reg12} thaler amongst ourselves. We will be happy to reward you with that sum, if you can win a peace. Convince {s12} and {s13} to accept a peace settlement, and if either of them proves too stubborn, make sure he falls captive and is not be ransomed until the peace deal is settled.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I cannot do this.

dlga_oim_ends_talk_to_monfore:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_1|My name is {playername}.^^How did you find yourself in these lands, sir? Where are you headed?
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_1:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4|I am of the Clermonts of Languedoc. Our line descends from the famed crusader, the Count Simon de Clermont. But unlike my magnificent ancestor, I have neither great titles nor vast lands. I served in Guard of Cardinal Mazarin, and was doing well for myself -- but then the devil made me his fool, and I challenged a certain D'Artagnan, lieutenant of the royal musketeers, to a duel. Fully knowing my skill with saber and pistol alike, the guileful Gascon thought to avoid the risk, and convinced the Queen that I secretly planned an attempt on the life of the young Louis. Thus, in the night on duel's eve, I was forced to flee Paris. And now I am doomed to wander the fields of Europe.
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_3|Tell me, sir, what is happening in these lands?
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_3:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4|The air smells of gunpowder and burning cities. Eastern Europe stands on the verge of a great war. For many years, the Zaporozhian Cossacks fought for freedom against the Polish gentry, but were nearly defeated -- and so, Hetman Bogdan Khmelnytsky was forced to turn to the Russians for help. Thus, not long ago in Pereyaslav, the Council of Cossack leaders known as the Starshina swore allegiance to the Russian Tsar, Alexei Mikhailovich. ^Now the Tsar marches with the Cossacks, and together they are preparing an attack on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the King of Sweden and the Crimean Khan look on, awaiting the outcome of the coming conflict. That is all I know. If you meet any soldiers on the road, you might learn further news from them... They should know far more than I.
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|Tell me of...
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20|Of what?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_21|Could you tell me of the Cossack Hetmanate?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_21:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|The Cossacks fight for their freedom and dream of one day forging their own state, one like the Polish Commonwealth, and just as powerful. But in this new nation, the Catholic Pole -- the lyakh, as the Cossacks call him -- he would no longer find himself among the gentry. Instead, all titles would be held by Orthodox Cossack leaders. Some years ago, the Zaporozhian Host, in a series of bloody battles, forced the Polish crown to grant them limited sovereignty, but now the times have changed. Today the Ukrainian Hetman fights under the hand of the Tsar of Moscow.
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_22|Could you tell me of the Polish Commonwealth?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_22:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|That is the most amazing state I have ever seen. It is a feudal republic, comprised of three major groups of people -- the Poles, the Lithuanians, and Russian-Ukrainians. The nobility is nearly all Polish. All the important decisions, including who is to be king, is determined by their congress, which they call the Sejm. But the Polish gentry is unruly, which leads to constant strife and a divided military. Unless they make up their minds and come forth in unity and strength, soon they will be conquered by their autocrat neighbors.
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_23|Could you tell me of the Muscovite Tsardom?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_23:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|The Time of Troubles has long since passed in Russia. Now a new dynasty of Tsars, the Romanovs, seek to regain the lands once seized by Poland, and expand their nation with the orthodox lands in the West. Alexei Mikhailovich has resolved to regain all the Russian lands that today are claimed by the Polish Commonwealth. The host of the Tsar is vast, and he plans to drive them forth any day now.
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_24|Could you tell me of the Kingdom of Sweden?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_24:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|The Kingdom of Sweden so far remains neutral to both the Muscovites and the Poles, but it keeps its cold eye on their northern lands. No one has any doubt that it shall draw its hands around the throat of whichever nation loses the coming war. The Swedes have an impressive army, dreaded by all of Northern Europe.
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_20:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_25|Could you tell me of the Crimean Khanate?
dlga_oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_25:oim_talk_to_monfor_intro_19|Islam Giray, aided Bogdan Hmelnitski, depends on an independent Cossack Hetmanate to shield him against both the Muscovite Tsardom and the Polish Commonwealth. Islam Giray passes for a lavish ruler, and thus far he has sided with the Cossacks. But now that Ukraine has allied with Russia, there are rumors that the Tatars would betray the Cossacks, and ally with the Polish Commonwealth instead.

Oh, and the Crimeans too would love to grab their share. If you are asking for my counsel -- visit the cities, where you can buy arms and supplies, and learn the latest news... The local rulers, lords, mayors, and even village elders might give you jobs of various kinds. My sincere advice, though -- do not take on more than you can handle. And yes, don't get me wrong, but visiting the odd pub can be quite useful. There one can find all manner of men who could help you on your way, and you might hire some skilled warriors, or even test your strength against others for pay.
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_what_to_do|What would you advise I do from here?
dlga_oim_first_talk_to_monfore_what_to_do:oim_first_talk_to_monfore_4|These are troubled times, and a mercenary, especially one that has known command, is worth his weight in gold. Start with small jobs, I would say -- take your time to get accustomed, and understand the local affairs. Wipe out some bandits, do some freelance jobs -- escort a merchant convoy or protect a village... After that you might try enlisting with one of the rulers -- you'll earn a reward, maybe even get yourself an estate, which by turns would also bring you some coin. Once you gather some loyal warriors and earn a name for yourself, you might lay siege to a stronghold, throw your backing behind a claimant to the throne, or even start a rebellion yourself!

dlga_oim_intro_zamoshie_elder:oim_intro_zamoshie_elder_1|Why, hello there... Mikhay's my name. We are Rusyn, but we live under the Polish gentry. We have heard say that the Russian Tsar wants to regain our lands, and has set out to make war with the Polish king. He leads his host to Smolensk. Word has also come that the Cossack Colonel Zolotarenko stands nearby with his army, calling all free men to the Zaporozhian Host, to fight under his banner.
dlga_oim_intro_zamoshie_elder_1:oim_intro_zamoshie_elder_4|And do you have some work for me? Something that will give me a chance to swing my saber, win myself some glory -- and fill my purse! It's a little too empty at the moment...
dlga_oim_intro_zamoshie_elder_4:oim_intro_zamoshie_elder_5|Aye, there is always work for a daring soul such as yourself. Believe it or not, the colonels of the gentry just sit in wait for the Muscovites, huddling in their towns, fearing to stick their nose out of the gates. Meanwhile, bandits roam the roads, giving travelers and merchants no peace... We cannot even travel to the bazaar, for fear of being overtaken! And to make matters worse, the blasted warlord of Smolensk taxes us so heavily that we have nothing for ourselves, and will soon be reduced to starvation...

dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_1|Greetings, brother Cossack. Where is it you're heading?
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_1:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_2|Greetings to you, stranger. I am Colonel Vasil Zolotarenko, and I am leading the Cossacks to aid the Tsar of Moscow, under the orders of the Hetman.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_2:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_3|So it is true that Cossacks and Muscovites are now united against the Polish king?
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_3:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_4|Yes, 'tis true... You know the saying: even old men are strong in numbers. Thus our glorious hetman Bogdan Hmelnitski has made a bargain with the Muscovite Tsar -- together we shall beat the Poles! The orders of the Hetman are such that my regiment, together with marksman warlords, will take on the Polotsk. But meanwhile, in addition to the Poles -- may the devil take them! -- a new foe has appeared: the Crimean Khan.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_4:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_5|What has the Khan of Crimea to do with this war? Crimea is a distant land, far away from Smolensk...
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_5:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_6|I see you know little of our local affairs... The Khan would not sit idly by as one of his neighbors gains overwhelming strength. Thus he sends spies to Lithuania, to see who would win this war -- and whom he should support.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_6:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_7|And you have seen hide or hair of these Tatar spies?
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_7:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_8|Why, of course we have. We even caught one. Told us quite a lot, the infidel.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_8:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_9|Now we are looking for a loyal {man/lady}, one who might deliver to the Sich this infidel captive, along with the deed in which all that he told us is written. Perhaps you could aid us in this, friend?
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_9:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed|Agree...
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_1|Would that I could, but I dare not take the journey alone, I fear.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_1:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_2|Truly spoken. The task is perilous, and the path is long. But if you should make up your mind to go, I shall give you money for your travel, and a pair of good, reliable Cossacks.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_2:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_3|Very well, Colonel. I shall set out at once to the Sich. Where is this infidel of yours?
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_agreed_3:close_window|We're bringing him out now. Do not fail me, {playername}. The Sich of the Cossacks shall reward you in our traditional way.

dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_9:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_negative|Refuse...
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_negative:oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_negative_1|Nay, colonel, escorting prisoners is not for me.
dlga_oim_zolotarenko_bring_tataring_start_negative_1:close_window|As you wish. But know this: we Cossacks treat our friends with open arms, but those who are no friends of ours will find no quarter amongst us. Do not make a choice you will regret later.

dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_1:oim_tatarin_first_talk_2|What is it now?
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_2:oim_tatarin_first_talk_3|Please -- untie my hands and give me water. I promise I shall not run away.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_3:oim_tatarin_first_talk_4_1|Untie him and give him a drink...
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_4_1:oim_tatarin_first_talk_4_2|All right, quit whimpering, I'll untie you. Here is the water flask.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_4_2:oim_tatarin_first_talk_6|Thank you, dear {sir/madam}. I thought I would die of thirst. To show you my thanks, I shall tell you something important.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_3:oim_tatarin_first_talk_7|Leave the prisoner bound...
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_7:oim_tatarin_first_talk_6_1|Be quiet. One more word and I'll chop off your head, Zolotarenko's orders be damned.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_6_1:oim_tatarin_first_talk_6|Don't be angry, {sir/madam}. Allow me to speak a few words to you in private. It's very important.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_6:oim_tatarin_first_talk_10|Well, what is it? Speak, and be quick about it!
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_10:oim_tatarin_first_talk_11|I notice you have little knowledge of local affairs. In the name of Allah the most merciful, I assure you that we, the servants of the Khan of Crimea, have betrayed no one and do not wish to attack anyone.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_11:oim_tatarin_first_talk_12|Right, and the next thing you'll say is that the Cossacks betrayed you.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_12:oim_tatarin_first_talk_13|Verily so, mister! The Cossacks have made a brotherly bond with our sworn enemy, the Tsar of Moscow. After they wipe out the Polish Commonwealth, they shall turn their pistols towards Bakhchisaray, and bring war to our people.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_13:oim_tatarin_first_talk_14|And how would you know that?
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_14:oim_tatarin_first_talk_15|I posed as a merchant, and brought some carts to Bryansk. There I bribed a courier who was carrying a message from Hmelnitski to the Tsar. That letter explained all the treacherous plans of the Cossacks and the Muscovites.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_15:oim_tatarin_first_talk_16|And you have this letter, I assume?
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_16:oim_tatarin_first_talk_17|Yes, I made a precise copy of it. Here, read it.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_17:oim_tatarin_first_talk_18|Hmm. Interesting things it says: "...and afterwards, Your Highness, Tsar of Moscow, we shall gather our forces and march upon Crimea. You may take Bakhchisaray, Kafa and Azov, while I lay claim to Akkerman and Sugdeya. And once the Tatars have fallen, we shall visit our good friend, the Sultan of Istanbul..." 'Tis well written, but I do not trust you. Had this deed the Hetman's seal, it would be quite another matter. But this you could easily have forged yourself.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_18:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19|Believe me, {playername}-bey!!! I swear by Allah this is all true. Free me, my good {man/lady}, and together let us deliver this terrible news to Perekop. The Mirza shall reward you greatly. Believe not the Cossacks, for they will deceive you.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_neg|Do not trust the infidel...
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_neg:close_window|Hey Cossacks! Give this godless heathen a taste of the whip. Tie him fast and put a piece of lard in his mouth, to still his dark speeches and dirty tongue.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp|I had best let him go, but steer myself out of harm's way.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp1|Very well, Tatar. Your words have the ring of truth, but I do not wish to bring the anger of the Cossack Sich down upon my head. If you have any money hidden away, give it to me -- and then I will help you escape.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp1:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp2|There is some silver is inside my hat. Take it and leave me there by the tree. Then in a while, send pursuers after me. I will be far away by then.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_otp2:close_window|That is what I will do. Give me the hat.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_perekop|I will bring the Tatar to Perekop. I badly need money right now, and this reward sounds most promising.
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_perekop:oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_perekop_1|Very well, Tatar. You have convinced me. We head for Perekop. But forget not, the Mirza had better draw a hefty reward from his pouch...
dlga_oim_tatarin_first_talk_19_perekop_1:close_window|Not just the Mirza, but his serenity the Khan himself shall repay you for this noble deed. Give me a saber and a horse, and take me into your company.
dlga_oim_tatarin_loopback:close_window|Why do we stop? The road is long. Let us get underway.
dlga_oim_kozaks_tell_failur:close_window|So this is how you keep your word to the Colonel! We shall ride to the Sich at once, and tell everyone of your betrayal! You shall pay for this!
dlga_oim_bring_tataring_to_sich_sich_dlg:oim_bring_tataring_to_sich_sich_dlg_1|Please, tell me -- to whom should I give the captive Tatar?
dlga_oim_bring_tataring_to_sich_sich_dlg_1:close_window|Ah, him -- you should go to the Kosh Ataman, Pavlo Gomon. He is in charge of military matters.
dlga_oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start:oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_1|I have brought the Tatar spy whom Zolotarenko took captive near Smolensk.
dlga_oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_1:oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_2|You have arrived just in time. That infidel is of great importance.
dlga_oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_2:oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_3|He is in the cart. Your Cossacks can find him there. But tell me, why is he so important?
dlga_oim_gomon_bring_tataring_start_3:close_window|Zolotarenko sent him as a sign. That infidel is our proof that the Crimean Khan is preparing to stab us in the back. This cannot be allowed to stand! We shall set forth at once! Here, take this gold for your faithful service. The Cossacks shall always remember this deed.
dlga_oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop:oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_1|Halt, Mirza! Quiet your dogs. Don't you recognize me? Speak not my name -- that is an order.

And as for this valiant warrior, see that he is rewarded generously.
dlga_oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_1:oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_2|Remember, I expect a hefty reward.
dlga_oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_2:oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_3|Here it is. We value your faithful service.
dlga_oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_3:oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_4|So perhaps you have not deceived me. But why conceal your name, for the devil's sake?
dlga_oim_tatarin_end_qst_perekop_4:close_window|Quiet. Speak not the shaitans' name in vain. And the time has not yet come for you to speak out my name either. If you wish to know it, come into the service of our Khan. A war is brewing, and we shall need good men like you. But for now, farewell.
dlga_oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev:oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_1|Greetings, {sir/madam}. I have news of a job well-suited for one such as you. Some days ago, the peasants from the village of Sivash visited this town. They were looking to hire a small mercenary squad to protect them from bandits.
dlga_oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_1:oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_2|Well then, perhaps you could extend your protection to them yourself?
dlga_oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_2:oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_3|Nay, I am a noble Bek. 'Tis no good for me to fight for such rewards as our pitiful peasantry have to offer. But it would be a fine job for you. And yes, they pay with their meager provisions, not with silver.
dlga_oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_3:oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_4|So be it, I shall help the peasants.
dlga_oim_start_quest_sem_samuraev_4:close_window|Then waste no more time here. Find six warriors for your company and head to Sivash. You'll have a week.

Our king would like to enlist the Cardinal's support, and he requires a trusted messenger to discuss the matter with Clermont.
dlga_oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_5:oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_6|But why so urgent? And could you not simply approach Clermont on your own?
dlga_oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_6:oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_7|Bogdan Hmelnitski wishes to arrange his own agreement with Mazarin. Once he discovers that we have enlisted Clermont to our service, he shall stop supporting us in our war with the Polish Commonwealth. Therefore we need a little-known mediator.
dlga_oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_7:oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_8|Agree...
dlga_oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_8:oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_9|I presume the reward would amount to more than the kind favors of the Swedish royalty?

dlga_oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_13:oim_start_quest_monfor_shved_14|I'd be better swinging my saber. Courtly intrigue is not for me...

dlga_oim_monfor_talk_shved_king_1:oim_monfor_talk_shved_king_1_pos|I have arrived with the Chevalier de Clermont, Sire. It is said that you wished to speak with him.

dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_1:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_2|And what is this village guilty of, that it would so enrage the Polish crown?
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_2:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_3|Every last homestead has sent their able men to aid those damned Zaporozhian rebels. But that is merely half the reason. The Ukrainian serfs require a lesson in power, that the rest would learn to dread the very idea of supporting Hmelnitski.
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_3:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_4|So what, the valiant soldiers of His Royal Majesty cannot fulfill this brutal duty?
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_4:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_5|Sending in the royal hosts would be... lacking in finesse. Nay, far better to enlist a warrior who has no name for himself. In this way, we might teach all those who might stand against the Polish Commonwealth that we have the support of every man who can mount a horse and draw a blade.
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_5:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_pos|Agree...
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_pos:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_pos1|Well, if such is the will of His Majesty, then so be it.
dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_pos1:close_window|Perfect! Hurry to Maslov Brod and give those villains a good thrashing. Whatever loot you find is yours to take. And here, take this as well, as payment for deeds well done.

dlga_oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_neg:oim_start_quest_mest_i_zakon_dlg_neg1|This matter is not to my liking. I pray you find someone else.

dlga_oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_2:oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_3|There can be no doubt 'twas the damned Poles that sent you. By Christ, please just leave us in peace. You had best know that Maslov Brod is no mere village.

dlga_oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_3:oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_4|And why should this concern me?
dlga_oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_4:oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_5|Hmelnitski shall never tolerate such plunder. If you do not wish the Hetman as your worst enemy, then you had best be on your way.
dlga_oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_5:oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_6|So that's what this is about... No one told me this! And what shall you tell your Hetman if I turn away from your village now?
dlga_oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_6:oim_elder_talk_maslovbrod_7|If you should leave in peace, we would tell the Hetman of your noble act. Believe us, Hmelnitski can be very gracious.

dlga_qst_mest_i_zakon_talk_end_2:lord_pretalk|The task is failed, and now the king is angered. You shall not be pardoned for this!
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_1|Could you perhaps do me a small favor, {sir/madam}? The task is this: we had planned to give our ruler a pure-bred stallion, but alas, war has called and I cannot deliver the beast. Can you convey the animal to him in my stead?

dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos2|Very well, I would not shy from taking this job.

dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_3:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_4|What is that supposed to mean?
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_4:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_5|No need for rude words, wayfarer. Better show us what you have in the cart, now.
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_5:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_6|In the cart be arms, and I assure you I can use them...
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_6:close_window|Then we shall just have to see about that...
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg2:close_window|I believe not my eyes! Verily a royal steed you have, my good {man/lady}. To possess such a treasure, a {man/woman} must be able to wield his saber with great skill. Perhaps we shall take it!

dlga_oim_horse_delivered_dlg_1:close_window|What a beautiful stallion! Truly my subjects must love me, if they bring such gifts. But it is taking a great risk, travelling these roads with such a horse. Here, take this for your troubles.
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_1|Aye, I have an errand for you, {sir/madam}. As you may know, the treasury of the Cossack Hetmanate is empty...

dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_1:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_2|A simple job. Why not send one of your men?
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_2:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_answ|Nobody must know of it. Therefore has the Cossack Starshina have decided to bestow the task upon an unknown man.

dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_answ:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos1|Agree...
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos1:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos2|Set yourself out then, and do not tarry. The Hetman will offer a reward that befits the task.
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos2:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos3|But how will the elder recognize me?
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_pos3:close_window|The password is the motto that Cardinal Richelieu ordered written upon the cannons.

dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_neg:oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_neg1|I fear this task is not for me.
dlga_oim_start_quest_invest_dlg_neg1:close_window|Well then, we shall just have to find someone more brave and resolute.
dlga_lord_talk:oim_invest_get_pass_lord|Could you tell me, what is the motto that Cardinal Richelieu ordered written on the cannons?
dlga_oim_invest_get_pass_lord:close_window|With fire and sword! Everyone knows that.

dlga_oim_invest_get_pass_lord:close_window.2|On cannons? It is probably "si vis pacem, para bellum" -- if you wish for peace, prepare for war.
dlga_oim_invest_get_pass_lord:close_window.3|What could a French Cardinal order? "Dura lex, sed lex" -- the law is harsh, but it is the law.

dlga_qst_oim_invest_finish_3_fail:qst_oim_invest_finish_3_fail_1|Do not be cross, Hetman. The road is long -- and I endured some expenses...

dlga_oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_4:oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_5|Choose your side and fight in their battles. Then you shall swiftly learn who are your friends and foes. But to gain the patronage of kings, magnates, and commanders, you shall have to earn quite a fair name... a better name than you have now.
dlga_oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_5:oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_6|How then can I earn a fair name, as you say?
dlga_oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_6:oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_7|Take up different tasks. Take me for instance -- even now I ride to France on a secret mission bestowed upon me by the Tsar of Moscow himself.
dlga_oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_7:oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_8|Counsel me, whom should I approach for such jobs?
dlga_oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_8:oim_rekomendaciya_k_trubeckomu_9|Well, you may be in luck. I have recently received a patent from Prince Trubetskoi.

dlga_oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg:oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_1|I have a letter of credence from the Chevalier de Clermont, Prince.

dlga_oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_2:oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_3|Laying siege to towns is no easy task. The longer it lasts, the more provisions their villagers smuggle in for them, and this is something we cannot allow to happen.

dlga_oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_3:oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_4|I shall accept the task.
dlga_oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_4:oim_trubeckoy_rekomendation_dlg_5|This is my kind of job, Prince! I hear that the British monarchs gave out patents that permitted their men to attacking enemy settlements during their wars with Spain. Therefore I am no bandit, but a land-bound privateer!

dlga_oim_potop_german_mercanaries_4:close_window|I would have been your ally against the uprising, but not in your abolition of the Republic. And if you should call in your mercenaries, I shall drive them back wherever they came from.

dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_1:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_2|Good day to you too, Colonel Zagloba. What brings you here?
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_2:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_3|Word came to me that you parted ways with Jan Kasimir. And not in a good way...
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_3:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_4|This is true. The King resolved to disband the Sejm, and abolish the Sejm. I see now that I was wrong in trying to protect him.
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_4:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_5|I warned you! Better you had listened to old Zagloba, eh? For my voice is the people's voice! So, what do you plan to do now?
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_5:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_6|Well... I already routed the mercenaries that the King sent against the gentry.
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_6:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_7|So you're finally ready to support the true patriots?
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_7:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_pos|Yes, I am ready.
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_pos:close_window|Good then. Let me say, I always believed in you. And here -- I shall give you your first assignment! Try speaking to the gentry, and inspire them to our cause. Today I am but a lonely rebel in hiding, but they will listen to you.
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_7:oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_neg|I am still not ready to stand openly against the king.
dlga_oim_potop_zagloba_return_dlg_neg:close_window|Everyone has their own truth, be it gentry or the monarchs. You'll just have to decide yourself how you must strike the balance. I shall leave now for some other place...
dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss:lord_dlg_king_dismiss_1|I have heard that you are displeased with the King, sir. Word has it that he should be forced to abdicate.
dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss_1:lord_dlg_king_dismiss_2|I am displeased with many things. But at present I am not ready to join his opponents.
dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss_2:lord_dlg_king_dismiss_positive|I can pay you {reg0} thaler.
dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss_2:lord_dlg_king_dismiss_positive.1|Do it for me.

dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss_2:close_window|Our forces are more powerful than the royal banner-wavers!
dlga_lord_dlg_king_dismiss_2:close_window.1|We shall speak again.

dlga_oim_potop_king_before_execution_talk:oim_potop_king_before_execution_talk_1|Your Majesty, I warned you that the people are not to be trifled with. The masses do not wish to live as before, and the elite cannot be contained.

dlga_oim_potop_king_before_execution_talk_2:oim_potop_king_before_execution_talk_3|Here is a paper which lacks only the King's signature. Your loyal Colonels may escort you...

dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_1|Jan Kasimir has abdicated in a cowardly manner and fled. What are your plans now?
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_1:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_2|What of them? A Sejm is coming, one in which the gentry shall elect the new King of the Polish Commonwealth.

dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_4:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_5|I am saying that a powerful nation must have a powerful ruler.
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_5:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_6|And you have one in mind?
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_6:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_7|Of course. A famous warrior, an illustrious warlord, well-respected by the gentry.
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_7:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_8|And who would that be?
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_8:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_9|You.
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_9:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_10|Me? You suppose that a kinless warrior could be elected king?
dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_10:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_11|Perhaps not... but if you exploit the confusion and seize the crown by force, many shall flock to your banners.

dlga_oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_12:oim_potop_king_execution_zagloba_talk_13|I think we might be able to persuade them. A saber, a pistol, and a band of well-weathered lads -- all heavy arguments in any quarrel.

dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_1|I see you are a friend of our nation. Hear this, then. Troubled times have befallen the Republic of the gentry. The fires of Cossack rebellion has scorched Ukraine. Just as the soldiers of the crown overcame the Cossacks, so has Hetman Hmelnitski sworn allegiance to the Russian Tsar.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_1:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_2|I heard that the Tsar of Moscow has levied war against the Polish king...
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_2:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_3|These words are true. A great host has entered Lithuania, and together with the Cossacks it threatens our forces.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_3:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_4|What of the Tatars?
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_4:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_5|The Tatars are now our allies, and fight with us against the Cossacks. However, their alliance is frail. Today they may cast their lot with us, but come tomorrow, if Hmelnitski allows them to take taxes from Ukrainian villages, they might once more side with the Cossacks.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_5:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_6|And what of the King of Sweden?
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_6:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_7|The new King of Sweden, Carl Gustaf, thinks only of how to bribe Polish magnates and invade the lands of the Great Poland. He gathers his men, and bides his time until we are bled white by our war with Muscovy.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_7:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_8|Dear, dear... The situation is worse than ever.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_8:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_9|Any crisis, as the Latin scholars say, is an opportunity. Wars blaze up one after the other, and nations once unconquerable may one day tremble like leaves in the wind. Old dynasties pass, and make way for new ones.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_9:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_10|Why do you speak of this?
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_10:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_11|To show you that if you fight for the Polish Commonwealth, you have much to gain! I call you to our ranks!
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_11:lord_pretalk|The Polish Commonwealth is a mighty nation. Fighting on your side would be an honor.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_11:oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_12|Sorry to say this to you, but I feel your cause is lost.
dlga_oim_potop_intro_to_the_quest_12:lord_pretalk|Bah! Your nation is the author of its own misfortunes. You and your liberal gentry will have to do without the likes of me.
dlga_oim_getman_initial_dlg:oim_getman_initial_dlg_1|You know of {s10}? A messenger just arrived from there, and tells of a bandit attack on the village. Make haste and go to their aid, or they are surely doomed.
dlga_oim_getman_initial_dlg_1:close_window|Yes, very well. I'll help the villagers.

dlga_oim_getman_init_dlg_old_man_2:oim_getman_init_dlg_old_man_3|Hear me... You protected this village from bandits, which proves that you are no foe of the Cossacks. I am the last keeper of a great secret...

dlga_oim_getman_init_dlg_old_man_5:oim_getman_init_dlg_old_man_6|Very well, what is it?
dlga_oim_getman_init_dlg_old_man_6:close_window|The tale of the Black Mace -- find it, and you shall save...

dlga_oim_getman_asking_about_getman:lord_pretalk|That's the first time I hear anything of this.
dlga_oim_getman_asking_about_getman:lord_pretalk.1|Nay, there's nothing by that name here.
dlga_oim_getman_asking_about_getman:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm... sounds like some kind of tool of witchcraft to me.
dlga_oim_getman_asking_about_getman:lord_pretalk.3|Ask the Chevalier de Clermont. He is a master of legends and tales. Whatever he hears, he writes down in his special book.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_1|Clermont, I am told that you might know of the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_1:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_2|Ah, where have you heard of it, {playername}?
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_2:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_3|Well... it is a strange tale. One old man was mortally wounded by bandits, begged me to find the Black Mace. Sadly, he died before telling me anything of value.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_3:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_4|Yea, I once heard mention of the Black Mace. Alas, I know little more than you. Word has it that it is a very ancient legend...
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_4:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_5|And who told you of it?
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_5:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_6|Once during a long drinking-bout, when word came to us that the Zaporozhians were defeated, a Cossack spoke these strange words: "The Black Mace! If only it were in our hands, we would drive those damned Poles all the way to Paris, and the Muscovite dogs back to Siberia..." 
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_6:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_7|Does this Cossack have a name?
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_7:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_8|His name is {s5}.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_8:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_9|This is something at least -- thank you.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_9:oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_10|Well, enjoyable labors never feel too difficult. I shall set out at once.
dlga_oim_getman_klermon_help_answer_10:close_window|I must warn you... Legends of old often conceal ancient evils. Be careful -- and God's speed.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg:lord_pretalk|I have no knowledge of what you speak.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg:lord_pretalk.1|Breathe not a word of it. This is none of your concern.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg:lord_pretalk.2|I do not know you well enough to speak of these matters with you.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_1|Well, I see you are a noble {man/woman}, and well worthy of my trust. Yes, I have heard of the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_1:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_2|And what is that?
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_2:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_3|The Black Mace is an ancient relic, forged of rare metals. If the legend is true, its wielder shall never know defeat.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_3:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_4|And how came you to know of it?
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_4:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_5|Our bards sing an ancient song of the Black Mace, a song that has passed from generation to generation -- the legend of a relic destined to save Ukraine. But it is only sung in presence of Sich Cossacks. Thus no other man can learn the secret.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_5:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_6|The more I know, the more I want to learn the rest. Is there anything else?
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_6:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_7|I can perhaps offer you one thread to follow. A few years ago, our forces drove the damned lyaki across the lands. At one point, we took a banner bearer from the personal company of the Lithuanian prince Janusz Radziwill, and he tried to buy his life by telling us all the secrets of his master.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_7:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_8|And? Did he save his life?
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_8:oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_9|No, we hanged him anyway. But not before he swore that he had heard Radziwill often talk of the Black Mace. Hear me now, friend. If you have set out to discover this secret, you must enter the service of the Zaporozhians. Find Radziwill, and discover what he knows.
dlga_oim_getman_kozaks_service_dlg_9:lord_pretalk|Very well, I'll do it.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_service_klermon_advice:oim_getman_kozak_service_klermon_advice_1|{s2} told me nothing when I asked him of the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_service_klermon_advice_1:close_window|Nor would he. That Cossack is a plain enough fellow at first glance, but truth be told, Cossacks can keep secrets well, and never trust strangers. You must attempt to earn his friendship, if you wish to get any information out of him.
dlga_pretender_start:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion|Tell me, Prince, why is the Black Mace so famous.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_1|How did you come to know of the Black Mace? That secret is shared between but few men of knowledge.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_1:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_2|It cannot be so great secret if bards sing of it in taverns...
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_2:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_3|So that is how it is... Well then you shall just have to ask the bards why it is so famous.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_3:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_4|Let us leave the jokes aside, Prince. Honestly, I feel a real connection with that mace, and I want to find out what it is.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_4:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_5|The secret of Black Mace is kept by the ancient houses of Lithuania, such as us, the Radziwill. These secrets are not meant for the ears of the strangers.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_5:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_6|And what if I become a friend to the Radziwill?
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_6:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_7|How could that happen?
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_7:oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_8|Perhaps by aiding you in winning the throne.
dlga_oim_getman_talk_about_rebellion_8:pretender_start|Ah, I see. Well then yes, anyone who would help the Radziwill could count on their patronage.
dlga_oim_radzivil_dlg_orders:oim_radzivil_capture_first_castle|As the rightful king I should take over a capital, even a temporary one. I would much prefer the thickness of stronghold walls, rather than wandering across the nation with your troops.
dlga_oim_radzivil_capture_first_castle:oim_radzivil_capture_first_castle_1|What can I do?
dlga_oim_radzivil_capture_first_castle_1:close_window|Leave me guarded by a trusty garrison in any city you take. I shall make it my capital.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_city_captured:oim_getman_radzivil_kiev_kapture|Excellent! Now you can always find me in {s2}. Here is a modest amount for your war expenses.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_kiev_kapture:oim_getman_radzivil_kiev_kapture_1|Our war of liberation has proven quite a success. Yet to move further we must drive our foes from Kiev, and the sooner the better. Capture the city and speak to the mayor. He is loyal to me, and will tell us if anyone be preparing for treason.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_kiev_kapture_1:close_window|Yes, Prince, I shall move out at once.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_captured_dlg:close_window|Marvelous. But we have learned from a captive rebel that there is an uprising brewing in Kiev against the King. We must discover if this is true.
dlga_oim_radzivil_dlg_orders:close_window|The mayor of Kiev reports that some colonels are preparing a rebellion, and are intending to hand over the city to the enemy. You must go to the mayor and investigate the matter.

dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_1:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_2|The bidding of the Prince is to know the names of the traitors.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_2:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_3|Indeed there were murmurs among the warlords, but after his many victories, no one would dare betray him. Radziwill has captured Kiev once before. It was then that a strange event came to pass...
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_3:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_4|What happened?
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_4:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_5|I know not if I should speak of it... A force was sent by Radziwill to ransack and plunder everything from the ancient monastery of Kirillovskiy.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_5:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_6|What is so strange in this? The Prince is Protestant. He would not hold a Catholic church sacred, nor for that matter an Orthodox monastery.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_6:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_7|But this is where it starts getting strange... The soldiers of the prince, under cover of night, brought from the Kirillovskaya church ancient sarcophagi belonging to Kiev princes of old. I have no idea why they would be interested in such strange artifacts.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_7:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_8|This is interesting indeed. Tell me more.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_8:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_9|Ah, what else is there to tell... It was so long ago, and my poor memory is failing lately.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_9:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_10|Here, take his purse. Perhaps it can aid your memory.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_10:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_11|Perhaps a modest donation to city needs, say 5000 thaler, could help me remember...
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_11:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given|So be it, here is the money.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_11:close_window|I will return once I have the money...
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_1|That happened after Bogdan Hmelnitski was crushed by Berestechek. The Cossacks fled, and the forces of Janusz Radziwill entered Kiev without resistance. I was a friend of the abbot of the Kirillovskiy monastery, and I concealed myself there, in hopes that the invaders would not find me.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_1:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_2|Do not lie to me! I know you are in cahoots with Radziwill, and you have been for many years now.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_2:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_3|Well, well. Just before the Lithuanian forces arrived, a messenger arrived with a letter from the Prince. He ordered to go to the monastery and meet his heralds.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_3:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_4|What then?
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_4:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_5|Then? Why, I opened the gate, let the troops in, and looked on as they hauled marble sarcophagi out on carts.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_5:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_6|What would Radziwill want with them?
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_6:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_7|I haven't the foggiest idea. The Kirillovskaya church was the family crypt of the nobles of the house of Oleg. Perhaps Radziwill believe them to be his own ancestors...
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_7:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_8|And where did they take them?
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_8:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_9|I know not. The soldiers were silent. Only their standard bearer, upon exiting the gates, took a sip of vodka from his flask, laughed, and said these words: "We have the Black Mace. Now we are ready for war!" 
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_9:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_10|Did I hear you right -- you said the Black Mace?
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_10:oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_11|Indeed.
dlga_oim_getman_kiev_burgomistr_gold_given_11:close_window|Very well, mayor, please continue to serve the city as best you can. But speak not a word of our talk here, or I shall hunt you down like a dog.^^It seems that Prince Janusz is not the simpleton as he pretends. I look forward to our next encounter...
dlga_oim_radzivil_dlg_kiev_report:oim_radzivil_dlg_kiev_report_1|And what did he say?
dlga_oim_radzivil_dlg_kiev_report_1:oim_radzivil_dlg_kiev_report_2|He says that Kiev is quiet. That the rebels are laying low.
dlga_oim_radzivil_dlg_kiev_report_2:close_window|Very well, here is a modest sum to further our cause...
dlga_oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg:oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_1|Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I am not yet King, but I may have an important mission for you. When you return, then we shall speak.
dlga_oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_1:oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_2|And what are your thoughts this time?
dlga_oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_2:oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_3|The Khan of Crimea is something of a problem. Much hangs on whom the Tatars shall ally with. March to Crimea, capture a Mirza and bring him before me. I must know everything first hand.
dlga_oim_getman_ask_add_info_dlg_3:close_window|So be it, Prince. I shall do your bidding.
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_1|Where from did you get this letter?
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_1:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_2|Some days ago we met a blind man on the roads. We searched him and found this paper. There is no one among my men who can read this script. The blind man was killed, and we are delivering word to the Khan.
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_2:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_3|You learned nothing from the blind man?
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_3:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_4|Only the name of the one that gave him the letter.
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_4:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_5|And who would that be?
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_5:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_6|It was only some trader. We caught up with him in half a day, and finished him as well.
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_6:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_7|Well then, this means that now only I know about the archives...
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_7:oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_8|What are you saying?
dlga_oim_getman_captured_tatarin_dlg_8:close_window|Nothing. Take the prisoner away, and keep him under close watch.
dlga_oim_getman_tatarin_captured:oim_getman_tatarin_captured_1|Good, I compliment your service. Here is your reward.
dlga_oim_getman_tatarin_captured_1:oim_getman_tatarin_captured_2|Thank you. You promised to tell me the secret of Black Mace, Prince.
dlga_oim_getman_tatarin_captured_2:oim_getman_tatarin_captured_3|Only I decide which secrets I tell -- and to whom. I told you once already that only when I have become king shall I tell you everything I know.
dlga_oim_getman_tatarin_captured_3:close_window|So be it, Prince. But do not take it amiss if I go to find things out on my own...
dlga_oim_getman_tampliers_archives_dweller_dlg:close_window|I know not, mister. Try speaking to the mayor.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_reject:close_window|You are not allowed into the archives without permission!
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_1|Sir, I must enter the archives. I need to examine an ancient Templar scroll.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_1:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_2|The town hall does indeed have some ancient papers, which bear the seal of the Order of the Temple.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_2:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_3|Tell me then, how did these Templar papers find their way to your town? The Templars have been gone for three hundred years.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_3:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_4|Yes, the order was abolished by the French king, but some part of the order's precious items and papers were saved by Teutons. It was they who brought these papers to Riga.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_4:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_5|Ah... the deeds of days gone by. But for now I am more interested in the future.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_5:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_6|I need permission to enter the archives.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_6:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_7|Surely, you are welcome to see them. But first you will have to receive permission from our lord.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_7:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_8|And how shall I go about that?
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_8:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_9|Well, best to find him and ask for yourself. It would be far easier were you yourself the {lord/lady} of Riga...
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_9:close_window|That's not a bad idea...
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_first_talk_6:oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_access|Of course you may see them.
dlga_oim_getman_riga_burgomistr_access:close_window|Nothing stands in the way.
dlga_lord_talk:oim_getman_get_pass_to_arch|I would like to see the archives. 
dlga_oim_getman_get_pass_to_arch:lord_pretalk|You are new around here. I cannot let strangers into the archives. 
dlga_oim_getman_get_pass_to_arch:lord_pretalk.1|It should not be a problem. The burgomaster knows that we are friends, so he will certainly issue a pass for you. 
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_location_redz:lord_pretalk|I know I owe you much... But your stubbornness begins to anger me. Now is not the time to speak of it.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_location_lord:lord_pretalk|I see you are a newcomer to our lands. We do not know each other well enough to speak of this..
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_location_lord:lord_pretalk.1|'Tis no secret, {sir/madam}. In the village of Nesvizh lies their family crypt.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_village_name:close_window|Very well, I shall tell you a legend of old, to amuse you... Here it is, as it was told to me. In times immemorial, when all the lands in this area were covered by impassable woods, the Lithuanian Prince Radziwill arrived here with his forces. His hunters found many wild animals in the wood, and soon all their boats were filled of game. But there was no room for a colossal bear whom the Prince had shot himself, and so they resolved to return for the bear another time. The servants they sent for the bear somehow lost their way, and found the giant only after a few days had passed. By this time, the carcass was no longer fresh -- in Lithuanian, that would be "Nesvizh"...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_1|I know not how to help you, {sir/madam}... How is it that you have come here? By someone's order or under your own will?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_1:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_exit|I seek the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_exit:close_window|We are but a small settlement, {sir/madam}. We know nothing of this...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_1:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_2|I serve Janusz Radziwill.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_2:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_3|Well, if you serve our new king, {sir/madam}, then hear my words. Some years ago, huge carts arrived to our old church. They were heavily loaded, but what was inside, no one knows.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_3:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_4|What else do you know, old man? Has anyone come asking after these carts?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_4:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_5|Yes, there was one. Some days before you, an old Russian Prince arrived here. And he asked about the crypt and tombs as well. And of the Black Mace he often spoke.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_5:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_6|What was the name of this Prince? And where would he be now?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_6:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_7|His name I know not -- he did not say. But as for where he is now, that I can tell you. Bandits took his life, not far from here. Naturally, we buried him like good Christians. Here, I will show you the grave.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_7:close_window|The grave is of no interest to me. But these bandits -- I think I should have a talk with them...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_1:oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_|I am here on my own. I am interested in ancient crypts.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_elder_dlg_:close_window|The place is dangerous. The foundations of the vault were laid by the great-grandfather of Janusz, Mikolaj Krzysztof Radziwill, known as The Orphan. He ordered a vast dungeon dug beneath the church, after he returned from a pilgrimage to Egypt. But if you are a brave {man/woman}, you may steel yourself and look inside.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk:oim_getman_deserters_talk_1|I heard you met a Russian Prince here lately.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_1:oim_getman_deserters_talk_2|Aye, this is true. Why do you ask?
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_2:oim_getman_deserters_talk_3|What was his name?
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_3:oim_getman_deserters_talk_4|Oh, smart fellow. If you want to know, then you shall give us some coins.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_4:oim_getman_deserters_talk_5|How much?
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_5:oim_getman_deserters_talk_6|A mere... 5000 thaler.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_6:oim_getman_deserters_talk_next|Very well, take it.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_6:close_window|I think we shall skip that part. Tell me all you know, or you are done for!
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_9:oim_getman_deserters_talk_12|I am all ears...
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_12:oim_getman_deserters_talk_13|I know precious little. It was just this old man riding through the woods with a few guards. Almost no money on him, no valuables -- but one ring with a seal. We didn't mean to kill him. He just fell off his horse and broke his neck.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_13:oim_getman_deserters_talk_14|And his name was?
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_14:oim_getman_deserters_talk_15|His servant told us that his name was Prince Boryatinsky.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_15:oim_getman_deserters_talk_16|At least that's something. Thank you. Now give me the ring and you can leave.
dlga_oim_getman_deserters_talk_16:close_window|Take it. It is not worth a dime. 
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg:close_window|I am busy...
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_1|Prince, I have brought sad news of your father.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_1:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_2|Tell me of all you know, {sir/madam}. I had almost given up hope of learning what happened to him.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_2:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_3|He died at a bandit's hand around Nesvizh. I am sorry, Prince.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_3:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_4|Oh, I told him not to go. Father, father... How did you learn of this?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_4:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_5|I was in Nesvizh and saw his grave.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_5:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_6|Perhaps you too are one of these bandits?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_6:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_7|Here is your father's ring.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_7:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end|You bring sad news. But 'tis better to know a black truth than nothing at all. You have my gratitude.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_7:close_window|So you have taken our family ring as well?! Prepare to defend yourself!
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_6:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_8|I, much like him, was following the trail of the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_8:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end|You bring sad news. But 'tis better to know a black truth than nothing at all. You have my gratitude.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_8:close_window|So you have even intruded on our family secrets? This will cost you your life!
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_6:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_9|If you trust me not, Prince, then I had better go.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_9:lord_pretalk|You won't be going anywhere until you tell me all you know. Otherwise, you have only yourself to blame for what befalls you.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_9:close_window|Very well, go now. Henceforth, let us stand away from each other, as distant mountains...
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_1:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_2|Well, Prince, do you still imagine that I murdered your father?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_2:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_3|No, I believe you, may he rest in peace. I see you are among those who know the secret of the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_3:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_4|Indeed. I discovered that the Black Mace is in the hands of Janusz Radziwill. It remains to be seen what he plans to do with it.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_4:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_5|I know not much of these legends myself... As a child, I was taught that we, the Boryatinsky, are the descendants of the noble house of Oleg. According to one of our family legends, we are the heirs who are to inherit a certain Black Mace... Father believed that by discovering the truth behind this secret, he would bring glory and wide esteem to our house. He set out to Kiev in his search, and from there to Nesvizh. Alas, I see it was all vain...
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_5:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_6|Have you perhaps some notes left by your father?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_6:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_7|There was a "Book of the Crow" at our estate. My father would read it over and over again. But I sold it... For a hefty sum, I might add.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_7:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_8|Sold it? To whom?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_8:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_9|A bookseller, whom else.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_9:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_10|What was his name?
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_10:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_11|Devil only knows. I did not ask, and he was quickly gone.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_11:oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_12|Well, that is something at least, thank you.
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_12:close_window|I would ask you for one thing only. Please let me go home...
dlga_oim_getman_knyaz_boryat_dlg_generik_end_12:lord_pretalk|And?
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_trader:oim_getman_buy_book_trader_1|And what book would that be?
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_trader_1:oim_getman_buy_book_trader_2|Book of the Crow.
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_trader_2:oim_getman_buy_book_trader_3|Yes, I have that book. It is quite rare, however... I suppose the price of 7000 thaler is just about right for such a rarity...
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_trader_3:close_window|Very well, connoisseur of antiquities -- here, take your thirty pieces of silver...
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_trader_3:close_window.1|I must consider whether I should buy such a costly item...
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_pufnutiy_search:close_window|I seem to recall... there is a scribe in the temple of Sophia in Novgorod -- Saint Pafnuty. He would know this ancient writ...
dlga_oim_getman_buy_book_pufnutiy_search:close_window.1|Nay, I know nothing.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_1|Oh Saint, word of your knowledge has spread across the whole world. Please, be so kind to help me discern, what is written in this book.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_1:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_2|You hardly resemble a lover of books, my son. Why would you need this knowledge?
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_2:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_3|I have been told it contains the descriptions of ancient arms. I am... quite interested in this subject.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_3:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_4|Very well, show me your book.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_4:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_5|Here...
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_5:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_6|This is indeed a very ancient tongue, and I do not understand much. I need a dictionary.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_6:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_7|I shall find a bookseller and buy the book you need from him.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_7:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_8|Such a book, my son, one cannot find at vagrant traders. There is but one such dictionary in the world, and it is in my library.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_8:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_9|So what is the trouble then?
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_9:oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_10|The trouble is that all my possessions are left in {s3}. I was sorting the archives, but I was forced to flee and abandon everything. Such is war... If you agree to escort me on my return, as gratitude for your service I shall translate this book for you.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_start_dlg_10:close_window|Very well, I agree. Let us move out.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_delivered_dlg:oim_getman_pafnut_delivered_dlg_1|Well, here we are. How much time will you need?
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_delivered_dlg_1:close_window|Return in two weeks, my son, and you shall have the translation.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_translated_book:oim_getman_pafnut_translated_book_1|So how is the work progressing?
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_translated_book_1:close_window|I am not finished yet. Come back later.
dlga_oim_getman_pafnut_translated_book_1:close_window.1|I have finished the translation. Here, you can take it.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs:lord_pretalk|A Cossack legend? Well, go ask the Cossacks then.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs:oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs_1|To your health as well, my friend. You shall need to speak with the Cossack known as Mamai. He knows all ancient tales, far better than any bard.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs_1:oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs_2|And where might I find him?
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legends_init_dlgs_2:lord_pretalk|Word is, he is retired, which probably means you can find him in the town pubs.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_1|Have you heard of a Cossack named Mamai? Well know this -- I am his descendant. I may not be strong enough to crush ten Poles under my boot, but I wield a pike quite well. However, I am beset by one sin... I am dying for vodka, so much do I love it. Help me, friend -- I have a debt to the innkeeper... Be kind, and pay my debt, and I shall obey your every wish.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_1:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_2|And what would be the amount of your debt?
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_2:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_3|Ah, but a small amount... 5000 thaler...
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_3:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_4|Good Lord! For that amount one could buy a hundred barrels of beer...
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_4:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_5|Well, nay not a hundred -- but a dozen it may be... But you see, I was not alone there making merry, but made a treat for all the guests of the inn. However, we then had a small fight with some visiting Poles...
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_5:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_6|Were I the innkeeper, I would strangle you with my bare hands.
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_6:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_7|So, will you pay my debt?
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_7:close_window|Ah, very well, so be it -- I shall pay...
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_7:close_window.1|Please understand, I am a little short on coins as well...
dlga_oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg:oim_getman_kozak_legend_mamay_dlg_7|So, can you pay my debt?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_1|I have heard what the bards sing at Cossack gatherings -- that the Black Mace shall return and raise Ukraine above all its enemies.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_1:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_2|And how might I hear this song?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_2:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_3|This is unlikely. The song has never been sung since Hmelnitski became the Hetman.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_3:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_4|Why is that?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_4:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_5|Hmelnitski is of the Polish gentry. He is no Cossack. The last true Hetman from the Sich was Barabash. He is the one who knows all about the Black Mace.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_5:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_6|Where can I find him?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_6:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_7|The rumor is that Barabash has died, but in fact he is very much alive, safe and sound, and travels from one town to another gathering allies.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_7:oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_8|Allies for what?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_kozak_legend_story_8:close_window|For what, you ask? He seeks to recover the ceremonial mace of the Hetman for himself.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_first_talk:oim_getman_barabash_first_talk_1|A Cossack by blood, I am. I was the regimental officer, then a Colonel, then acting hetman of the Zaporozhian Army. Throughout this, I always I strove to live in peace with the Polish gentry... Yet the field secretary, Bogdan Hmelnitski, stirred up the Zaporozhians of the Sich and began a rebellion. The Cossacks under my command aided the crown in quieting the rebels, but before the Battle of Yellow Waters, Hmelnitski managed to draw all the Starshiny to his side.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_first_talk_1:oim_getman_barabash_first_talk_2|Everyone says that you were slain by the traitors.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_first_talk_2:oim_getman_barabash_story|The night before the battle, they entered the Hetman's tent. Luckily, I was warned beforehand, and survived. They thought I was one of the bodies they cut to ribbons, but it was only my servant. What do I have to say of this? Simply this -- Hmelnitski has no care for the future of his people. He is moved by personal ambition -- and revenge. Have no doubt, he spells the doom for Ukraine.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story:oim_getman_barabash_story_1|The Black Mace is an ancient relic. Seven hundred years ago, Prince Svyatoslav Igorevich ordered it forged from a piece of celestial iron he seized from the soothsayers.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_1:oim_getman_barabash_story_2|The story of the mace I know well. I journeyed to Kiev and Nesvizh, spoke with Radziwill and Prince Boryatinsky, and read the Book of the Crow.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_2:oim_getman_barabash_story_3|So you know everything?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_3:oim_getman_barabash_story_4|Everything but this: What is the true power of the Black Mace?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_4:oim_getman_barabash_story_5|Ah, so that is what you seek... As legend has it, the mace is a mighty weapon of its own accord, and it gives its bearer the strength to unite all Cossacks under his rule.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_5:oim_getman_barabash_story_6|Would the Cossacks really follow anyone who wields it?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_6:oim_getman_barabash_story_7|Of course not... But were the Black Mace to land in the hands of one who could boldly lead the Cossacks to battle, the morale of his forces would be unbreakable.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_story_7:close_window|So that is why Radziwill was obsessed with it. Nevertheless, he cannot use the mace until he stands as chief of the Zaporozhian Army. He concealed the Black Mace in Nesvizh so that it could never fall into the hands of another. Perhaps it is time I visit his family crypt...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_nesviz_dlg_encounter:oim_getman_mamay_nesviz_dlg_encounter_1|There are many rumors about this place. The Radziwill line was never shy of magic, and once The Orphan returned from Egypt, why, I shudder at the stories. It is said that he planned to bring two mummies out of Cairo, but the seamen refused to take them aboard. A bad omen, I dare say. Then The Orphan ordered the mummies dissected into pieces and delivered in parts. I know not, however, if they were ever brought to Nesvizh, or if the ship's crew found their death on the sea floor...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_nesviz_dlg_encounter_1:oim_getman_mamay_nesviz_dlg_encounter_2|And why should we be concerned?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_nesviz_dlg_encounter_2:close_window|Not concerned... I just feel that there might be an ambush awaiting at the vault, so be careful.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner:oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_1|Speak now -- who sent you?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_1:oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_2|Janusz Radziwill...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_2:oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_3|You guard this place at his behest?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_3:oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_4|Nay, there is nothing to guard but these empty coffins. The lord took what was kept therein. But our orders remain to slay whosoever should come looking here.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_post_battle_dlg_prisoner_4:close_window|Very well, so we shall have to search for Radziwill.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_1|And how would you propose we find Radziwill?
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_1:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_2|Look upon the decree that Radziwill's soldiers carry through the towns and villages:
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_2:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_3|The royal decree of great Prince Janusz Radziwill. As we have come to know, the bandit {playername} raided our ancestral estate, ruined the place, slaying our serfs and plundering our family crypt. To all men of the Polish Commonwealth -- should you meet this bandit and heathen, report him at once. Should a member of the gentry come upon him with his troops, attack him at once and take into captivity. He who captures the dog shall receive a lavish reward, be he of noble blood or not.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_3:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_4|Surely with a sizable force one might challenge him and take him captive. Or one might lay siege to whichever fortress he's hiding in. But that would be a long victory, and meanwhile our Cossack colonels, hearing of the Black Mace, are swearing allegiance to Radziwill one after another...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_4:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_5|I fear my men will not be enough.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_5:oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_6|Here is my advice. Pose as a mercenary, sneak in the stronghold where Radziwill resides, and cut his throat...
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_6:close_window|Yes... I shall do as you say.
dlga_oim_getman_nesviz_mamay_dlg_6:close_window.1|No, Mamai. We shall defeat Radziwill honestly, on the battlefield.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivill_captured:oim_getman_radzivill_captured_1|How dare you, serf? Capture the king of the Polish Commonwealth? My subjects shall cut you to ribbons...
dlga_oim_getman_radzivill_captured_1:oim_getman_radzivill_captured_2|If you are the King, Prince Janusz, then I'm the Turkish Sultan. Nay, you are now my prisoner, and nothing more.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivill_captured_2:oim_getman_radzivill_captured_3|And what do you plan to do now?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivill_captured_3:close_window|I shall bring you before the Cossacks, and they shall decide your fate.
dlga_oim_getman_guard_dlg_before_fight:oim_getman_guard_dlg_before_fight_1|Oh, another mercenary! You must have long ears! You respond quickly to His Majesty's call for a new regiment. Where do you hail from?
dlga_oim_getman_guard_dlg_before_fight_1:oim_getman_guard_dlg_before_fight_2|I am an orphan. Since I was fourteen, I have been among freelance mercenaries. Many battles I have fought, for many masters...
dlga_oim_getman_guard_dlg_before_fight_2:close_window|Come inside the fortress. King Janusz the First himself shall speak to you. He is looking for personal guards. Go now, if you choose your words carefully, you may rise quickly.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_before_death:oim_getman_radzivil_before_death_1|So you are a new volunteer?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_before_death_1:oim_getman_radzivil_before_death_2|Yes, Sire!
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_before_death_2:close_window|Hmm, I somehow feel that I have seen you before. Turn towards the light... Oh my, yes indeed I know you! Guards! Seize the traitor!
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg:oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_1|Well, I see you managed to escape the fortress...
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_1:oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_2|Yes, over the shoulders of the late Radziwill's bodyguards and the town guard.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_2:oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_3|You mean you have slain Radziwill?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_3:oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_4|Indeed.
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_4:oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_5|And what of the Black Mace? Have you recovered it?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_npc2_dlg_5:close_window|Here it is, on my belt. But enough talk. Let us ride swiftly before they send pursuers. Although, they are probably rather too occupied there to think too much of us just now...
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_died:oim_getman_radzivil_died_1|Allow me to speak, {playername}! We were set to guard the captive Prince. But when morning came and we went to wake him, he was, well...
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_died_1:oim_getman_radzivil_died_2|Well what?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_died_2:oim_getman_radzivil_died_3|Well, how would a wise man say it... he was cold. Gave up the ghost. All the evening he was whining that his heart ached -- we could hardly sleep with his complaints. But it seems that it was no lie. So what should we do now?
dlga_oim_getman_radzivil_died_3:close_window|Bury him with all honors and let us move on.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken:oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_1|This cannot be! The very mace from the Cossack legend. Truth be told I never thought it existed for real... Well, {playername}, stand under my banner, let us gather all Cossack Starshina, and restore the Cossack nation to its former glory!
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_1:oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_2|You think of a rebellion against Hmelnitski?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_2:oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_3|Nay. Hmelnitski is cunning as a fox, and has gathered all the Starshina to his cause. He is also supported by Muscovites. Before we openly stand against the dog, we must first talk with the Colonels and show them the Black Mace -- draw them to our side. Only after we have the majority of their support shall we stand against Hmelnitski...
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_3:close_window|Forgive me, Barabash, but I do not believe in this plan...
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_pernach_taken_3:close_window.1|So be it, Colonel, I go to speak with the Cossacks.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused:oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_1|So what have you resolved upon with Barabash?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_1:oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_2|The Colonel proposed that we incite the Starshina to rebel against Hmelnitski.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_2:oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_3|And what was your response?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_3:oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_4|I refused.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_talk_babrabash_refused_4:close_window|So be it, then. Barabash shall become Hetman, and will restore the lands of the Polish gentry. Meanwhile, Hmelnitski will seek to forge a free Cossack nation. Let us go talk to Bogdan. Perhaps we shall fight at his side -- and who knows, you might even become a Marshal in time.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_1|Yes? What is it you wish to tell me?
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_1:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_2|First, you should know that Colonel Barabash, the former Hetman, is still alive.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_2:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_3|Ah, this is starting to make sense! And now I know who was behind the attempt on his life...
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_3:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_4|Indeed. It was Hmelnitski that ordered him dead.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_4:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_5|You say Hmelnitski was behind all of this? Perhaps it is true, or perhaps not. People shall say what they wish.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_5:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_6|My opinion of Hmelnitski is that he is leading Ukraine off a cliff. Instead of supporting the Polish Commonwealth, beside which Ukraine can once more take a worthy place, he poses as the long-lost brother of the Tatars, and then of the Muscovites...
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_6:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_7|And what do you propose?
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_7:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_8|I propose we take the Hetman's trappings from Hmelnitski and give them to Barabash.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_8:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_9|And you feel that Barabash is worthy of the title?
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_9:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_10|Aye, for he is the true Hetman -- and we do have this mace...
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_10:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_11|That is the Black Mace!
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_11:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_12|Indeed it is.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_12:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_pos|Well then, I am ready to follow he who holds the mace. Barabash must be Hetman. I am ready to stand beside him, if the uprising gains the support from the Starshiny.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_pos:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_generik|Many have already joined us. I shall let you know when Barabash is ready to commence the uprising.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_12:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_neg|You speak well, but that by itself is not enough... I do not yet know if I should move against Hmelnitski. First I must speak with the Cossacks.
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_neg:oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_generik|Well, the decision is yours, but I think you shall soon find my words to be true...
dlga_oim_getman_za_barabasha_lords_dlg_generik:lord_pretalk|Nevertheless, were I in your place, I would speak to Hmelnitski. Perhaps the situation is not quite as simple as the old Hetman told you...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_1|Ivan Barabash has long been lapdog to the damned Poles. When he became the acting Hetman, he levied unbearable taxes on the Cossack people, raising money to curry favor with the Polish king -- then helped to spread the Catholic faith. This traitor shall make all of Ukraine serfs to the Poles.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_1:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_2|And what you propose, Hetman?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_2:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_3|I propose not -- I do. The Pereyaslav council decrees that all Cossacks must swear an oath to the Tsar of Moscow. Only under the protection of an Orthodox nation may our people gain their freedom.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_3:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_4|So then, you only want what is best for Ukraine?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_4:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_5|Precisely so. And believe me, its future lies not with Catholic Poland. Only a Hetman who has lost his mind would fight for Poland against Russia...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_5:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_6|I see your political course has been carefully considered. I may come over to your side.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_6:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_7|Everything is in your hands. I have a faithful man placed very close to Barabash. Just a few days ago, word came from him that the former Hetman sent a messenger disguised as merchant to the new King of the Polish Commonwealth, carrying a secret package. If you should require evidence of his treason, capture that package and investigate its contents.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_7:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_pos|Agree...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_pos:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_pos_1|So be it, Hetman. I shall go forth to find that cart. If you indeed speak the truth, and Barabash is engaged in underhanded affairs with the Poles, then I shall become your trusted ally. But if we find nothing, understand that there is little I can do. But tell me one thing -- what route are these false merchants taking?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_pos_1:lord_pretalk|According to my spy, by now the carts will have moved out from {s3} and are heading to {s4}. God's speed.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_7:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_neg|Refuse...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_neg:oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_neg_1|Take your forked tongue back in your mouth, Hetman. I expect you devised all this to set me against the old Colonel.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_barabash_story_neg_1:lord_pretalk|Believe whatever you please, {playername}. But be aware -- the lives of my foes are often cut short, and their deaths are painful. Soon we shall meet again.
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_1|Spare me, oh noble warrior. Take what you wish -- take everything! But leave me my life.
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_1:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_2|Have no doubt that I shall take everything. But first I will speak with you of other things. Where is the package you carry to the Poles from Barabash?
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_2:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_3|What package?
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_3:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_4|I see you have lost your memory... We shall try to refresh it. Hey there lads -- whose hands are itching? We'll need one hundred lashes for this one...
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_4:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_5|Oh, please no, {sir/madam}! Here is the letter, inside this robe. Take it, for God's sake, but injure me not.
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_5:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_6|All right, the devil take you. Give me the letter and go to your cart.
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_6:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_7|Thank you, noble {sir/madam}. Even my children shall remember your kindness this day...
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_7:oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_8|So, let us see this letter: "...and to you, great King, may your years be long, I solemnly swear -- if your forces shall aid me in crushing Hmelnitski, may he be damned, and aid me in becoming Hetman of the crown, all of Ukraine on the right bank, with all its villages, hamlets, towns and strongholds, I shall give over to the gentry of Great Poland forthwith, as a lavish reward for Your Majesty's aid..." 
dlga_oim_getman_caravan_master_talk_8:close_window|So this is who you truly are, Barabash. And you speak of yourself as the defender of Cossack liberties. You just wait -- I'll come for you!
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_letter_captured:oim_getman_hmel_letter_captured_1|You were right, Hetman.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_letter_captured_1:oim_getman_hmel_letter_captured_2|Verily he shall make no little trouble if he is not stopped in time. So, are you ready to swear an oath to me?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_letter_captured_2:lord_pretalk|Yes, Hetman, I am.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_1|Yes indeed. It is time we join all our peoples together, and found a new nation.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_1:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_2|And what should it be called? The Polish Commonwealth or the Tsardom of Moscow?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_2:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_3|Neither. We shall restore the old Grand Principality of Rus.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_3:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_4|Which would be ruled by a Grand Prince, not by a Hetman. But would his heirs call themselves Tsars or Kings? Or better yet, emperors.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_4:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_5|You understand quickly. But first you must conquer the Muscovite Tsardom.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_5:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_6|Why delay then? You are Hetman, and I am Marshal. Give the word and we shall march.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_6:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_7|We have entered into alliance with them. Besides, our Colonels do not want this war. But if you stir their hostilities against us, our subjects shall rise up at once.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_7:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_8|And what would you propose?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_8:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_9|You must leave service. Thereafter you shall capture a city of the Muscovite Tsardom. The Muscovites will assume that it was our work, and declare war upon us. Meanwhile I shall hold my colonels at bay, explaining to them that you acted at my personal behest.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_9:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_10|A cunning plan. But after this, all Zaporozhian Colonels shall become my deadly enemies.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_10:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_11|Your good name will be restored in time. Once the war begins, I shall accept you back into service. For many, that alone would be a firm reason to change their attitude towards you. After this, simply fight well, win your battles, and soon enough, all shall be forgotten.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_11:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_12|Agree...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_12:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_13|I shall do it for a holy cause, the restoration of the Ancient Rus.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_13:lord_pretalk|So be it, then. In several days I shall announce the election of the new Marshal.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_11:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_14|I cannot commit an act of betrayal, even if it is only a pretense.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_dlg_14:lord_pretalk|I would rather begin the war by ordinary means. Any rebels shall be dealt with.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_1|Thus all our lands are united under one mighty hand. It does not do for such a vast nation, the successor of the Ancient Rus, to be named the Cossack Hetmanate. Glory throughout all ages shall be to the Grand Principality of Rus!
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_1:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_2|Then you are now the Grand Prince?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_2:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_3|'Tis no simple matter. Defeat is ever an orphan, but victory has many willing fathers. Many of our warlords have suddenly recalled their Rurik heritage, and now claim the throne.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_3:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_4|And what do you propose?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_4:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_5|If we allow elections, the Grand Principality will only become once more a place of feuding warlords, and its sovereign would be but the first among equals. Only a coronation can make me a true King. And for this, the crown of Prince Vytautas would work well enough.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_5:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_6|What is this crown you speak of?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_6:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_7|Vytautas the Great is the Grand Prince of Lithuania, and cousin to the Polish King Jogaila. Hand in hand with Jogaila, he fought at Grunwald with the Teuton Order, and gained so much influence that Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund himself offered him the crown of King. This crown was forged in the year 1340 and sent to Vilna, but it vanished along the route, and Vytautas himself died in Trakai, awaiting an anointing that never came.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_7:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_8|You are right. A crown that had vanished for hundreds of years would make a great symbol. Yet where would one begin to look for it?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_8:oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_9|You found the legendary Black Mace, did you not? I'm sure you can find the crown as well. Aid me in strengthening my grip on the throne, and I shall reward you as only a King can.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_casus_beli_end_dlg_9:lord_pretalk|It is a bargain then, Grand Prince to be.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_1|What troubles you, {playername}? No love from girls -- or is it a painful ailment? Drink some of this vodka, and your sorrows will be gone...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_1:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_2|Oh, Mamai, vodka cannot save me. The Grand Prince has assigned me a most difficult task -- to find the crown of Vytautas, which has been lost for three ages...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_2:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_3|Ten thousand devils take him! How in hell should we find it? Nay, in a case like this, one can hardly do without vodka! Fill the mugs!
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_3:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_4|To your health!
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_4:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_5|I remember now... There was a certain bard in the Sich. It was he who told the legend of three Polish knights who stood against an Orthodox prince, who was to receive the crown from the schismatics. Thus they took the crown by force, as it was being carried from Hungary to Vilna. Yet after Vytautas died, all of Lithuania was turned upside-down, and the ones who took the crown were stricken as if a curse had been placed upon them. One died in torment, and another hanged himself, but the third recanted of his deeds, accepted the schema and became a monk. And it seems he took the crown with him.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_5:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_6|And to which monastery did this reformed knight go? Did the bard speak of this?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_6:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_7|Nay, he did not. Yet when I was last in the area of Hortitsa, I saw that same bard. Let me go visit him quietly, and find out any other details.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_7:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_8|Certainly. Set out at once!
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_8:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_9|First, let me have 1500 thaler for my expenses. Who knows what I might encounter along the way.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_9:oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_10|Here, take it. -- But there are to be no drunken brawls in the taverns!
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_start_dlg_10:close_window|Worry not. I shall be swift as the wind.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_1|Here I am! Allow me to report, commander. I caused no brawls along the way, and though I may have taken a sip or two of vodka, it was only for the greater good. The way was long and hard, and just the other day I spent the last thaler...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_1:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_2|Be quick, delay not the answer! Did you find out anything?
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_2:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_3|That bard I spoke of died last summer.
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_3:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_4|Then all is lost...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_4:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_5|No, no, not all. The bard had a grandson, who knew all his songs and tales. He told me, after a small bribe, that the third knight took his monastic vows in the Trakai monastery. And he mentioned his name, too...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_5:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_6|So that grandchild took all the money out of your purse? Verily, that bard's lad shall go far... Very well, then let us waste no time and ride forth to Trakai!
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_6:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_7|The lad's tale cost me but half a thaler, with which I bought him a bowl of soup with dumplings. But there is no reason to ride to Trakai -- I was there already. From there I rode to Vilna, and plied the local cathedral archive keeper with vodka for three straight days. Oh that one is a bottomless pit, the schismatic! With what money was left I ordered the local scribe to make a copy of the ancient manuscript, which tells of all these events. The monks knew not of whom or what it spoke...
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_7:oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_8|Now let us see of what this ancient manuscript speaks: "...and the man who repented of his grievous sins was accepted as a brother, and took upon himself our monastic vows, among them a vow of silence. Thereupon he took his schema to a hidden refuge at {s3}, where he spent his last days in constant self-torture. The item he brought with him was hidden in his cell, to wait for its hour to arrive..." 
dlga_oim_getman_mamay_korona_finded_dlg_8:close_window|My gratitude for your service, Mamai! Very well then, I shall go to the Grand Prince...
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded:oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_1|Good news, my Prince! I now know where the crown has been kept. Gather our forces and let us march to seize it!
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_1:oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_2|This is good news indeed. But we cannot mobilize our forces. My position is too unstable for me to confront the clergy. Besides, we should rather claim that the crown has always been kept in my house, awaiting the right hour.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_2:oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_3|And what would you suggest we do?
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_korna_finded_3:lord_pretalk|There is one way -- you must dress yourself a monk, and go to {s2}. Once you sneak inside the monastery, do whatever you must to gain the crown.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_election_end_dlg:oim_getman_hmel_election_end_dlg_1|You have fulfilled your promises honorably. Now it is my turn.
dlga_oim_getman_hmel_election_end_dlg_1:lord_pretalk|Wait for the coming elections, and I shall find a way to influence their outcome. Alas, you have powerful adversaries.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_1:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_2|Who are you? What do you need?
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_2:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_3|I am a servant of Perun, the God of Thunder. Many in the Rus still worship the ancient gods. Pagans they call us...
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_3:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_4|And what do you need?
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_4:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_5|You have a thing that belongs to us.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_5:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_6|And what would that be?
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_6:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_7|The Black Mace, stolen from us by Radziwill. Return it to me. This mace must remain in the hidden sanctuary.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_7:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_8|I fear I cannot give it back, pagan. It is simply too powerful
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_8:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_9|There you are wrong, {playername}. It is but a mere mace. Perhaps upon hearing of its magical effects, you became convinced in your own strength, and found yourself an invincible warrior.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_9:oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_10|Very well, soothsayer. Here, take the Black Mace. My hope is that the Rus shall never have need of it.
dlga_oim_getman_volhv_last_dlg_10:close_window|Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_1|Yes there is. It is time to join all our peoples together, and found a new nation.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_1:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_2|And what should it be called? The Polish Commonwealth or the Tsardom of Moscow?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_2:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_3|Neither. We shall restore the old Grand Princedom of Rus.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_3:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_4|Which would be ruled by a Grand Prince, not by a Hetman. But would his heirs call themselves Tsars or Kings? Or better yet, emperors.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_4:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_5|You understand quickly. But first you must conquer the Muscovite Tsardom.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_5:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_6|Why delay then? You are Hetman, and I am Marshal. Give the word and we shall march.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_6:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_7|We have entered into alliance with them. Besides, our Colonels do not want this war. But if you stir their hostilities against us, our subjects shall rise up at once.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_7:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_8|And what would you propose?
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_8:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_9|You must leave service. Thereafter you shall capture a city of the Muscovite Tsardom. The Muscovites will assume that it was our work, and declare war upon us. Meanwhile I shall hold my colonels at bay, explaining to them that you acted at my personal behest.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_9:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_10|A cunning plan. But after this, all Zaporozhian Colonels shall become my deadly enemies.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_10:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_11|Your good name will be restored in time. Once the war begins, I shall accept you back into service. For many, that alone would be a firm reason to change their attitude towards you. After this, simply fight well, win your battles, and soon enough, all shall be forgotten.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_11:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_12|Agree...
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_12:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_13|I shall do it for a holy cause, the restoration of the Ancient Rus.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_13:lord_pretalk|So be it, then. In several days I shall announce the election of the new Marshal.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_11:oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_14|I cannot commit an act of betrayal, even if it is only a pretense.
dlga_oim_getman_barabash_casus_beli_dlg_14:lord_pretalk|I would rather begin the war by ordinary means. Any rebels shall be dealt with.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_1|Have you truly made up your mind to become king? Alas, all the thrones are occupied. But many a poor nobleman has raised himself up to become King. History is written by such men.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_2|Tell me, what do you mean?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_3|Do you not know? Only sixty years have passed since the son of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, Prince Dmitry, was murdered in Uglich. Soon rumors were circulating in Moscow that the child-killers had been sent by the new Tsar, Boris Godunov.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_4|Could it be true?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_5|Who knows what the truth is. All witnesses of these dreadful deeds were wiped out, along with their villages. One thing alone is true -- as soon as talk of murder began, the rule of Boris was all but finished.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_6|Yea, I've heard stories like this...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_6:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_7|Stories? My late grandfather told me of these dreadful years. In the middle of August, frost struck the lands of Moscow. All their bread was lost, and a great famine arose which lasted three full years. It was then that a man from Poland proclaimed himself Prince Dmitry.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_7:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_8|So the son of Ivan the Terrible was not murdered?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_8:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_9|Godunov tried to prove him dead, but the monk, Grigory Otrepyev, told another tale. He claimed he was Dmitry himself, and that it was the son of a priest that was murdered instead, while he himself was saved and hidden in the monastery by those loyal to the crown.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_9:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_10|And the people believed him?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_10:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_11|Alas, they did. Worse yet, all the Polish magnates aided him, for they dreamed of seeing their pawn seated upon the throne of Moscow. Many church leaders and noble Boyars of Rus took the side of False Dmitry. And the Don Cossacks even sent him a messenger to swear allegiance.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_11:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_12|And what followed?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_12:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_13|Everyone knows that. Otrepyev, with a small force, marched on to Moscow. Godunov sent his forces to pacify the uprising, but they betrayed Godunov and joined the impostor. And once the Boyars Basmanov and Shuisky, of noble houses, swore before the folk that Otrepyev truly was Prince Dmitry, Tsar Boris fell into illness and soon died. Meanwhile, Grigory Otrepyev, or whoever he really was, entered Moscow and was anointed as the sovereign Dmitry I.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_13:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_14|So that is how the Time of Troubles began...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_14:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_15|Indeed. Soon the Boyars, doubtful that Dmitry was indeed the son of Tsar Ivan, murdered him and rioted against the Poles in Moscow. Vasily Shuisky became Tsar, and soon another False Dmitry arrived, named by the people the Thief of Tushino -- and after that, impostors sprung up in the Rus like mushrooms after the rain...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_15:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_16|So the first False Dmitry was an impostor after all?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_16:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_17|Much water has flowed under the bridge since the day... Of those who know the real truth, no one remains. Although I do know one man who was in Otrepyev's company...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_17:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_18|Who is he?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_18:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_19|Oh, a clever one. That knowledge is quite valuable...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_19:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_20|And what do you want for it?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_20:oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_21|I have been ordered to lead a force through the lands of the Polish Commonwealth, and bring war to the Poles. I could use your aid in this. Ravage three Polish villages, and I shall tell you all I know. And at the same time, I shall see what sort of friend you are to the Muscovite Tsardom.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_21:lord_pretalk|I do not do battle with peasants.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_initial_dlg_21:lord_pretalk.1|I agree. It is a worthy deed.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_loot_villages_end_dlg:oim_dmitriy_loot_villages_end_dlg_1|There. I have had my share of fun. Three villages lay in ruin. Send report of victory to the Tsar, and tell me what you promised.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_loot_villages_end_dlg_1:lord_pretalk|Quite good! May these Poles be damned. We need more heroes like Ivan Susanin! As for that man you asked of, he lives in Trakai. He is a former Cossack Starshina, and goes by the name of Gerasim Evangelic.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_1|Our settlement is large. Many people call this their home. Perhaps the one you seek is among them, but perhaps not.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_1:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_2|There now, good sir, do not waste words on me. If you know where he can be found, but are hesitant to help a stranger without something in return, then speak plainly.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_2:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_3|Ah, plainly. Trakai has little use for your money, but we could use your help.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_3:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_4|And what help would that be?
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_4:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_5|A great difficulty has befallen us, {sir/madam}... We had a miraculous icon in our village chapel. We know not what it meant, but it was Orthodox, and it was ours. It was left here by the Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise himself, when he laid the foundation for the town of Yuriev. The Lithuanian name Trakai came to us later. Very recently, however, a Catholic priest arrived from Vilna with his soldiers, and plundered the chapel, taking everything we had "for the needs of his church".
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_5:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_6|And what do you want of me?
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_6:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_7|Find the priest and return the relic that is ours. -- And I shall reward you. I'll find out where Gerasim might be.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_7:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_8|I must think on this, old man. I am new to these lands... Where would I seek this priest?
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_8:oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_9|He lives in Vilna, {sir/madam}. Everyone knows him there.
dlga_oim_start_quest_trakay_icon_9:close_window|All right, I will try to help.
dlga_oim_tracai_icon_done:oim_tracai_icon_done_1|Well, my good {man/lady}, have you found the priest? Recovered our icon?
dlga_oim_tracai_icon_done_1:oim_tracai_icon_done_2|Yes, I found him. Followed him all the way to Riga, and spent quite some time persuading him. Here is your icon.
dlga_oim_tracai_icon_done_2:close_window|All our village shall pray for you, my good {man/lady}! That icon is worshipped by men from all the nearby villages... We shall tell them all who returned it to us. As for old Gerasim, he once resided here, but he is here no longer here. He left for {s4}.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_1|Old man, are you perhaps Gerasim Evangelic?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_2|Perhaps so. And what business of yours would that be?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_3|I heard you were a confidant of False Dmitry.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_4|Perhaps so, perhaps not. And why would you be curious?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_5|I want to know if he truly was the saved prince Dmitry or not.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_6|Five decades have passed since those days. All who lived in those troubled times have long passed into the grave. The bones of Dmitry have long moldered, and the Tsars of the house of Romanov today call him a traitor and an imposter...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_start_dlg_6:close_window|You named him Dmitry, not Grigory, old man. Would that mean he truly were...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_elder:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_elder_1|Sir, I spoke to the old Cossack Gerasim just now. Can you tell me where he is now?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_elder_1:close_window|Gerasim was severely wounded. He lay in one of the houses.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_1|I am back, old man. We overcame the bandits.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_1:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_2|I see you are a good warrior. You really wish to know of Prince Dmitry?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_2:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_3|Yes, old man, that is my wish.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_3:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_4|My wound is deep. I doubt I have much time left. Very well, I will tell what I can. In the days of my youth, I was a Starshina of the Sich. My troops hid on the Dnieper floodplain, and made raids on the Lithuanians, Poles, and Muscovites. Once a lad arrived at our camp... He was about twenty-five years old. Called himself Grigory, said he was a runaway monk. He told us that the name he had before he took his vows was Yuriy, and he was the son of the Galician Boyar Bogdan Yakov Zamyatni-Otrepyev -- a company commander who was knifed in Moscow by a drunken Lithuanian. Grigory asked to serve among my men, and wished to learn how to wield a sword and ride a horse. Every Cossack of mine back then was worth his weight in gold, so I took him in, taught him the arts of war, and started taking him on raids.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_4:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_5|This was the future Tsar Dmitry?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_5:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_6|Indeed it was. Later I came to learn that prior to donning the cloth, he resided in Moscow, and served at the house of prince Boris Cherkassky. Grigory learned how to read and write, and displayed quite some wit. He was unlike any ill born Boyar. Now the tales have it that he was an ugly, bow-legged man with misshapen hands, but in truth he was a true Prince on sight. And those who happened to have known Tsar Ivan Vasilievich admitted that the young man closely resembled the Terrible Tsar, even more that his elder son, whom he killed...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_6:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_7|So what happened?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_7:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_8|Soon enough, Dmitry left us and became sword-bearer for Prince Adam Vishnevetsky. It was there that he made known his true name. That is when word spread through all of Rus that the rightful heir to the throne yet lived.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_8:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_9|I heard you were among his closest companions.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_9:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_10|That is true. Dmitry Ivanovich sent for me after he met the Polish King Sigismund and was proclaimed the rightful claimant to the Tsardom of Moscow. He offered me the honor of leading his personal guard, and I accepted.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_10:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_11|You believed that he was not an impostor, but the real Prince?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_11:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_12|Yea, I believed it. He showed me a golden cross covered with gems, given to him by his godfather, Prince Ivan Mstislavsky. Besides, the real Yuriy Zamyatni-Otrepyev died soon after birth. I went to Galich myself to check. -- And he had a birthmark known to the Tsar's servants.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_12:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_13|So Dmitry was the true Tsar.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_13:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_14|So it would seem. Yet his reign was short. He had promised the Poles some of the lands of Russia in exchange for their support, but when he refused them this, they along with the Jesuits rejected him and consigned him to a certain death at the hands of the rebel Boyars. His death was dreadful.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_14:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_15|And how did you survive?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_15:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_16|Dmitry came to learn of the plot. He sent me to Warsaw with a secret letter to the king. Just after I left the city, I learned of his death. I disguised myself as a simple Cossack, and returned to the palace, only to find his torn and broken body. Beside it I found the very cross I spoke of before.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_16:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_17|So you have been a wanderer ever since?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_17:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_18|Yes, I have wandered. But now it seems that my path comes to an end. But now, listen well to my words... Do you see that chest box? Inside it there is a good pistol, some silver I have kept for a rainy day, and the cross of Tsar Dmitry. Take it and do with it as you please.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_18:oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_19|Thank you, old man.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_gerasim_last_19:close_window|Spare me your thanks. Avenge Dmitry's death if you truly wish to express your gratitude. Many Boyars of the noble houses are displeased with the Romanovs. Find the Marshal-warlord of Moscow and gain his confidence. Now go... The village folk will bury me as a Christian.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_1|{Sir/Madam}, what wind brings you to our lands? We heard that the Swedes attacked Poland. The council is in turmoil, and all the roads are closed. Our merchants no longer carry their goods, and instead sit in town making no profit.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_2|A deep bow to you from Gerasim, who goes by the name of Evangelic.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_3|Hmm... Eh... Who is this Gerasim? It's the first I've heard of him...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_4|That who is known to you from the Time of Troubles. He instructed me to pay homage to you as he died.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_5|As he died, you say? Thank Go... I mean to say, most unfortunate... But again, I do not know of whom you speak...

dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_6:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_7|Silence, you wretch! I know no Dmitry. Aye, my father supported the impostor, the False Dmitry, but he had a small mind, and for this our family has already suffered greatly. Do not stir up the past. Be gone from this place.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_7:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_8|I see your point, warlord. Times are difficult these days... And he who would dare to recall the past might not just lose an eye, but could well lose his very head. In any case, I have said nothing to you, and you have heard nothing from me.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_8:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_9|I see you have a sharp mind and a quick tongue. I need men like you. In fact, I have a certain delicate affair that I shall entrust with you.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_9:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_10|What would that be? I seek to gain glory and fill my purse.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_10:oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_11|The niece of the Swedish king, Eleanor, is our guest here at Novgorod. Here is your order -- to escort the princess to Allenstein Castle, where Carl Gustaf now resides. If you do this, you will earn the Tsar's favor, and the gratitude of the king of Sweden. And I shall offer you reward as well. The prison chief shall provide you all that is necessary.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_elena_init_dlg_11:lord_pretalk|Well, certainly such a task is to my liking. I would like to visit Carl.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_mayor_talk:close_window|Perfect, then. We shall load the cart, and then you may go forth with our celebrated guest...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_1|Hear me, {playername}. I must tell you something!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_1:close_window|I have no time for talk.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_2|I am all ears.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_3|In Novgorod I dared not open my mouth. The warlord of the town wants to please everyone -- the Novgorod council, the Moscow Tsar -- and even the King of Sweden. He did not tell you who I really am, did he?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_3_neg|That is of no concern to me.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_3_neg:close_window|Were you the beloved wife of the Turkish Sultan, I would still bring you to castle Allenstein.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_4|I suppose not. So who are you?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_5|I am not Carl's niece, but the former wife of his nephew, Olaf. My name is Alevtina, and I am the only daughter of the Boyar Nikita Odoyevskiy. I have been forced into an arranged marriage at the insistence of King Carl.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_6|But I was told you were kept hostage in Novgorod.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_6:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_7|You were deceived. My husband Olaf died three months ago of gluttony. After the funeral, I fled to Novgorod, but the warlord feared Carl's wrath, and resolved to return me to him. He spoke to you with a forked tongue, believe me!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_7:close_window|This means nothing to me. Let us carry on.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_7:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_8|So you do not want to go to Castle Allenstein?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_8:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_dlg_9|Please, bring me to my father, {sir/madam}. He shall reward you with an open hand.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_1|A long road I traveled to get to you, warlord. I have brought your daughter from Novgorod.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_1:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_2|Thank you for this fine deed, {sir/madam}! I shall not let you go before I give you a worthy reward.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_2:oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_3|Perhaps I could be of further service, warlord?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_eleonora_delivered_odoevskiy_3:lord_pretalk|Indeed you can, {sir/madam}. Head to Moscow and relay my message to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_msk:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general|Your Majesty, Boyar Nikita Odoyevsky offers a low bow for the salvation of his daughter.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_1:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_2|My name is {playername}. I would like to enter your service, Your Majesty.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_2:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_3|Well, the Muscovite Tsardom is in need of good warriors. Come closer. Bow down before me.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_3:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_4|Yes, Your Majesty!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_4:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_5|What is this cross around your neck? It looks familiar. There is one just like it inside the Armory. These two crosses were forged for the sons of Ivan the Terrible at his behest! Where could a mere warrior get it?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_5:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_6|Hear me, Your Majesty...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_6:oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_7|Nay, I shall not hear a word! This cross can only fall into the hands of the impostor, or his wicked offspring. Our torturers shall discover the truth behind this!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_leter_delevered_general_7:close_window|Guards! Take him!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_init_dlg:oim_dmitriy_razin_init_dlg_1|Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich placed a high bounty on the head of the new impostor. Word has it that he is the grandson of the impostor Grishka Otrepyev.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_init_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_razin_init_dlg_2|Dmitry was the true son of Ivan the Terrible. As for that lad -- God knows who he truly is.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_init_dlg_2:lord_pretalk|Perhaps you have heard? Ataman Stepan Razin claims a right to the throne as well.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_king_talk:close_window|You dare to come into my halls in person! Guards, to arms!
dlga_oim_dmitriy_king_talk:close_window.1|You are still quite the fool! Well then, your death shall be as swift as that of Grishka Otrepyev...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_1|I have good cause to seek you. All the villages are full of rumors about the rightful heir of the house of Rurik -- the great-grandchild of Ivan, and the grandson of his son, Dmitry.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_1:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_2|Well, what can I say...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_2:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_3|Whatever you may say, you cannot fool the people. For they are wise, and shall always know a true Tsar from an impostor.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_3:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_4|Is it truly important to you who I am?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_4:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5|It is best that he be a good man, one whom the Boyar and the folk shall be eager to follow. So tell me, are you ready to join the uprising, Prince Dmitry?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5_pos|Agree...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5_pos:oim_dmitriy_talk_razin_first_5_pos_1|Very well, I'll risk it. Perhaps I may become Tsar after all! Spread the word, Ataman -- we march at dawn!

dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_sp_task:oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task|Yes, we must make preparations. If we fail to draw the Boyars to our side, the cause is lost.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task:oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_1|Do you have any ideas?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_1:oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_2|I knew a runaway serf who served in the house of the warlord Nikita Odoyevsky. He told me that often, noble Boyars would gather there and talk of sedition, calling the Romanovs a house of ill born upstarts.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_2:oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_3|You propose we negotiate with Odoyevsky?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_3:oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_4|Yes. Ride there and try to persuade him to join our cause.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_boyars_task_4:supported_pretender_pretalk|Good. I shall ride out at once.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_1|Rebellious talk that is. Lighter conversation has found people in torture chambers. Were it not for the cross of Rurik on your chest, I would have sent you to the dungeon myself...
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_1:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_2|So you know who I am?
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_2:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_3|I know of all that transpires in the Tsardom of Moscow. If a mouse should sleep in the Tsar's bedchamber, I would have a report about it. I heard that the Tsar Alexei himself took you for a descendant of the house of Rurik, and placed you at the top of his list of wanted men.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_3:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_4|I know many things as well. For one, I know that you, one of Tsar Alexei's most trusted allies, arrange secret Boyar gatherings, where you weave treasonous plots.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_4:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_5|We, the Boyars of the noble Russian houses, installed the Romanovs as Tsars -- and we can just as easily remove them. Tsar Alexei has strengthened his grip, and thinks he shall live by his own mind. He offered his royal support to the heretic, Patriarch Nikon, which led to a schism in the Orthodox Church. What else he devises no one can say. This is why we Boyars gather secretly, our only concern the utmost good of the Motherland...
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_5:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_6|A rare occasion it is indeed, when the Boyars and the common people are one in their aspirations. I and Ataman Razin call you to stand against the Romanovs, and see a true Tsar sitting in the Kremlin.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_6:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_7|With Razin's support, we certainly could drive the Romanovs from power. Their house is of bad blood, and if a direct descendant of Rurik should step forth, we would indeed support him. Yet for now I cannot act against the Tsar.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_7:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_8|Why is this, Boyar?
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_8:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_9|I simply have no time for this now, {sir/madam}. My daughter, my darling Alevtina, was captured by the Tatars. While I was of town with my troops, they came here on a raid, and took her from the tower. If Alevtina should die in Tatar bondage, my soul would know no rest. Seeing her free is my first and only task.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_9:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_10|I feel for your loss, but how does this misery bar you from taking a stand against Alexei?
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_10:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_11|The Tsar of Moscow promised to send an embassy to Crimea and plead for Alevtina's return. And if he should do this for me, I would serve him hand and foot.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_11:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_12|And what if I release Alevtina from bondage?
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_12:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_13|Hear my words. If you bring Alevtina back home, I shall side with your righteous cause, and bring many other Boyars with me.
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_13:oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_14|And where shall I look for her? Perhaps you can offer some advice?
dlga_oim_biyars_specnaz_init_dlg_14:close_window|The main slave marketplace is in Kafa. Ride there and try to find out about her.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_nikita_auto_responce:close_window|I see Alevtina is not with you, so waste not my time...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_1|I hear little, ya. The esir were brought from Rus, there was that girlie, much beauty, but much naughty.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_3|I hear very bad, ya. Not know Russian, no words...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_4|I feel your pain. All right, how many coins to cure your deaf ears?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_5|Not a very much, ya. Just 3000 thaler.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_6|All right, take the money and speak...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_6:ransom_broker_pretalk|Hear me, {sir/madam} - the Boyar girl Alevtina was a slave, in Kafa. She be sold, I thinks, sold to {s2}. She go with him to {s3}.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_ransom_brok_dlg_5:ransom_broker_pretalk|I shall return later...

dlga_oim_dmitriy_aletina_hanum_murza_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_aletina_hanum_murza_dlg_3|Well, if you pay a hundred thousand, I may think it over.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_aletina_hanum_murza_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_aletina_hanum_murza_dlg_castle|Well, if you don't want to do it the easy way, we shall do it the hard way.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_aletina_hanum_murza_dlg_3:lord_pretalk.3|Well, no is no.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_2|The new doctor. I have come to see the wives of the Mirza at his behest.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_3|I have not seen you before, eh?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_4|I just arrived the other day.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_alevtina_guard_dlg_6|I'll make a eunuch out of you!

dlga_oim_dmitriy_alevtina_garem_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_alevtina_garem_dlg_4|Go home? Sit in a room with a spindle, look out the window and freeze in the winters, when snowdrifts grow as tall as men? No way. Here I have my halls, my servants, luxurious dresses and jewelry. The Mirza loves me...

dlga_oim_alevtina_delivered_dlg_3:lord_pretalk|How can I not? Now that Alevtina is back home, and I owe the Tsar nothing. We shall give merry hell to those Romanov tricksters. I am at your command, as is my army -- and here, take this deed as well. It shall help you draw other Boyars to your cause.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_1:oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_2|It is too early to think on such things. Razin shall be provisional commander, and then we shall gather the national council.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_4|And what do you propose?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_5|As if you do not see it yourself! Why would we put a Cossack Ataman at the helm of our nation, or gather puppets for needless jabber, when we have the rightful heir to the throne amongst us.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_sarin_na_kichku_dlg_6|You speak of me?

dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_2:oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_3|I beg you, Your Majesty. Alexei has been routed, and rightful power is restored and once more shared between all.

dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_3:oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_4|And what is it that you desire, Stepan?
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_4:oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_5|Nothing that I have not earned. Give me the rank of warlord, and command over the Boyar Council.
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_5:oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_6|It is a very ambitious request...
dlga_oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_6:oim_dmitriy_razin_ending_dlg_7|Forget not that I know who you truly are. Thus my plea is modest. Should I instead cry out "impostor", and see your corpse be dragged from the Kremlin in parts, like the first Dmitry?
